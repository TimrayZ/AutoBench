You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	input [7:0] c,
	input [7:0] d,
	output reg [7:0] min
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT module is named 'top_module' and has four 8-bit unsigned input signals (a, b, c, d) and one 8-bit unsigned output signal (min).",
    "2: The primary functionality of the DUT is to take four unsigned numbers as input and output the minimum value among them as the output 'min'.",
    "3: The DUT utilizes standard comparison operators to determine the minimum value between the inputs.",
    "4: The input signals are expected to be in the range of 0 to 255 (for 8-bit unsigned representation).",
    "5: The testbench should generate all possible combinations of input signals (a, b, c, d) in a systematic way to ensure full coverage of the input space.",
    "6: Expected results for each set of input signals should be calculated manually or programmatically before execution of the testbench, ensuring that all scenarios (including similar values) are accounted for.",
    "7: The testbench should include checks that compare the output 'min' from the DUT against the expected minimum value for any given set of inputs.",
    "8: The testbench should include a reporting mechanism to indicate whether each test case has passed or failed, and should provide appropriate debugging information in case of failure."
