You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Suppose you are designing a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and vibration motor. Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call (input ring), your circuit must either turn on the ringer (output ringer = 1) or the motor (output motor = 1), but not both. If the phone is in vibrate mode (input vibrate_mode = 1), turn on the motor. Otherwise, turn on the ringer.
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input ring, 
	input vibrate_mode,
	output ringer,
	output motor
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

{
  "important data": "The DUT must have the following operational characteristics: When ring = 1 and vibrate_mode = 0, output ringer = 1 and motor = 0; When vibrate_mode = 1, output ringer = 0 and motor = 1. It must never allow both outputs to be high at the same time. Inputs are ring (1 bit, signifies an incoming call) and vibrate_mode (1 bit, signifies if the phone is in vibrate mode). Outputs are ringer (1 bit, activates the ringer) and motor (1 bit, activates the vibration motor).",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Module Header: module top_module(input ring, input vibrate_mode, output ringer, output motor);",
    "2. The DUT should turn on the ringer (ringer = 1) when ring = 1 and vibrate_mode = 0.",
    "3. The DUT should turn on the motor (motor = 1) when vibrate_mode = 1.",
    "4. The DUT must ensure that the ringer and motor outputs are never both high at the same time.",
    "5. The testbench should initialize inputs, apply stimulus to the DUT, check outputs, and report whether they match expected results."
