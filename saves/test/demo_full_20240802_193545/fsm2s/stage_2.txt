You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
This is a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output. Implement this state machine in Verilog. Reset is an active-high synchronous reset to state OFF.

// OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF
// OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON
// ON (out=1) --k=0--> ON
// ON (out=1) --k=1--> OFF
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "State Transition Table: OFF (out=0), ON (out=1). State transitions based on inputs j and k with active-high synchronous reset.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT is a Moore state machine with two states: OFF and ON.",
    "2: There are two inputs: j and k.",
    "3: The output signal is 'out', which reflects the current state of the machine.",
    "4: The reset signal is active-high and synchronously resets the state to OFF.",
    "5: The state transitions are defined as follows: OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF; OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON; ON (out=1) --k=0--> ON; ON (out=1) --k=1--> OFF."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input j,
	input k,
	input reset,
	output out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the system with reset active (reset=1) and wait for 1 clock cycle. Release reset (reset=0) at the next clock cycle. Set j=0 and k=0 during reset and the first clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set j=1 and k=0 for one clock cycle after releasing reset. This should transition the state to ON.",
  "scenario 3": "Set j=0 and k=0 for two clock cycles while the state is ON. Verify that the state remains ON.",
  "scenario 4": "Set j=0 and k=1 for one clock cycle while the state is ON. This should transition the state to OFF.",
  "scenario 5": "Set j=1 and k=0 for one clock cycle after transitioning to OFF. This should transition the state back to ON.",
  "scenario 6": "Set j=0 and k=1 for one clock cycle while the state is OFF. Verify that the state remains OFF.",
  "scenario 7": "Set j=0 and k=0 for one clock cycle, followed by immediately setting j=1 and k=1 for the next clock cycle. This should transition to OFF during the ON state.",
  "scenario 8": "Activate the reset signal (reset=1) for one clock cycle at any time, followed by releasing reset (reset=0) after the clock edge. Set j=0 and k=0 during this cycle."
