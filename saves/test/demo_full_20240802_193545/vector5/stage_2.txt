You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given five 1-bit signals (a, b, c, d, and e), compute all 25 pairwise one-bit comparisons in the 25-bit output vector. The output should be 1 if the two bits being compared are equal. Example: out[24] = ~a ^ a; out[23] = ~a ^ b; out[22] = ~a ^ c; ... out[ 1] = ~e ^ d; out[ 0] = ~e ^ e.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Given five 1-bit signals (a, b, c, d, and e), compute all 25 pairwise one-bit comparisons in the 25-bit output vector. The output should be 1 if the two bits being compared are equal. Example comparisons include out[24] = ~a ^ a; out[23] = ~a ^ b; out[22] = ~a ^ c; ... out[1] = ~e ^ d; out[0] = ~e ^ e.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. Module Header: module top_module (input a, input b, input c, input d, input e, output [24:0] out)",
    "2. Input signals: 5 one-bit inputs (a, b, c, d, e)",
    "3. Output signal: 25-bit output vector (out)",
    "4. Output logic: out[n] = ~(input1 ^ input2) where input1 and input2 are combined from inputs a, b, c, d, and e for all pairwise comparisons.",
    "5. Total number of comparisons: 25 pairs from 5 signals (each signal compared with every other, including itself).",
    "6. Expected output should match the condition where out[i] is 1 if the corresponding bits are equal and 0 otherwise."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input a,
	input b,
	input c,
	input d,
	input e,
	output [24:0] out
);
