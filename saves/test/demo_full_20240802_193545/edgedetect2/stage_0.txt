Please generate the verilog RTL code according to the following description and header information:
problem description:
For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect any edge). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.
RTL header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [7:0] anyedge);

please only reply verilog codes. reply_format:
```verilog

```verilog
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] anyedge
);
    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        anyedge <= (prev_in & ~in); // Detect a transition from 0 to 1
        prev_in <= in; // Store current input for the next cycle
    end
endmodule
```
