You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect any edge). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: DUT detects transitions in an 8-bit input vector from the previous clock cycle to the current clock cycle.",
    "2: The DUT outputs a high signal on the corresponding output bit if a 0 to 1 transition is observed in the input during the previous clock cycle.",
    "3: The DUT uses a clock signal (clk) to synchronize the detection of transitions and the generation of output signals.",
    "4: The DUT has one clock input (clk), one 8-bit input (in), and one 8-bit output (anyedge).",
    "5: The output (anyedge) is of type 'reg', indicating that it can hold its value across clock cycles."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [7:0] anyedge);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

  "scenario 1": "Set the input 'in' to 8'b00000000 at clk cycle 0. Change 'in' to 8'b00000001 at clk cycle 1. Keep 'in' constant at 8'b00000001 for subsequent clock cycles. This tests the detection of a 0 to 1 transition.",
  "scenario 2": "Set 'in' to 8'b11111111 at clk cycle 0. Change 'in' to 8'b11111110 at clk cycle 1, and then revert 'in' back to 8'b11111111 at clk cycle 2. This tests the system's ability to ignore a 1 to 0 transition.",
  "scenario 3": "Set 'in' to 8'b00000010 at clk cycle 0. Change 'in' to 8'b00000110 at clk cycle 1. Hold 'in' steady at 8'b00000110 for the next clock cycle. This checks that multiple bits can transition at once.",
  "scenario 4": "Initialize 'in' to 8'b00000000 at clk cycle 0. At clk cycle 3, transition 'in' to 8'b00000011. Hold 'in' constant for three clock cycles, then revert to 8'b00000000. This tests the detection after several cycles.",
  "scenario 5": "Set 'in' to 8'b10101010 at clk cycle 0. At clk cycle 1, change 'in' to 8'b10101011. At clk cycle 2, transition 'in' to 8'b10111011. Hold 'in' constant for two clock cycles. This tests multiple transitions.",
  "scenario 6": "Initialize 'in' to 8'b00000001 at clk cycle 0. At clk cycle 1, change 'in' to 8'b00000000, then back to 8'b00000001 at clk cycle 2. This tests the ability to handle transitions back to the original state.",
  "scenario 7": "Set 'in' to 8'b11110000 at clk cycle 0. Transition 'in' to 8'b11111000 at clk cycle 1 and back to 8'b11100000 at clk cycle 2. Hold 'in' for the next two clock cycles. This examines the detection of back-and-forth transitions."
