You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, a = %d, b = %d, out_assign = %d, out_alwaysblock = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, a = %d, b = %d, out_assign = %d, out_alwaysblock = %d", "scenario: 1b, a = %d, b = %d, out_assign = %d, out_alwaysblock = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module(
	input a, 
	input b,
	output out_assign,
	output reg out_alwaysblock
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block. 
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Build an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Header: module top_module(input a, input b, output out_assign, output reg out_alwaysblock);",
    "2. DUT Function: The DUT must implement a logical AND operation.",
    "3. out_assign should use an assign statement to represent the output result of the AND operation from inputs a and b.",
    "4. out_alwaysblock should use a combinational always block to also represent the output of the AND operation from inputs a and b.",
    "5. Input signals: a (input), b (input).",
    "6. Output signals: out_assign (output), out_alwaysblock (output reg)."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set input a to 0 and input b to 0. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set input a to 0 and input b to 1. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Set input a to 1 and input b to 0. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set input a to 1 and input b to 1. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Toggle input a from 0 to 1 with input b fixed at 0. Observe outputs at each change.",
  "scenario 6": "Toggle input b from 0 to 1 with input a fixed at 0. Observe outputs at each change.",
  "scenario 7": "Toggle both input a and input b simultaneously from 0 to 1. Observe outputs after the changes.",
  "scenario 8": "Set inputs a and b to high impedance (if applicable in your simulator or setup) and observe outputs."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, a = %d, b = %d, out_assign = %d, out_alwaysblock = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, a = %d, b = %d, out_assign = %d, out_alwaysblock = %d", "scenario: 1b, a = %d, b = %d, out_assign = %d, out_alwaysblock = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
