You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block. 
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Build an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Header: module top_module(input a, input b, output out_assign, output reg out_alwaysblock);",
    "2. DUT Function: The DUT must implement a logical AND operation.",
    "3. out_assign should use an assign statement to represent the output result of the AND operation from inputs a and b.",
    "4. out_alwaysblock should use a combinational always block to also represent the output of the AND operation from inputs a and b.",
    "5. Input signals: a (input), b (input).",
    "6. Output signals: out_assign (output), out_alwaysblock (output reg)."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input a, 
	input b,
	output out_assign,
	output reg out_alwaysblock
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Set input a to 0 and input b to 0. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set input a to 0 and input b to 1. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Set input a to 1 and input b to 0. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set input a to 1 and input b to 1. Observe outputs with a delay of 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Toggle input a from 0 to 1 with input b fixed at 0. Observe outputs at each change.",
  "scenario 6": "Toggle input b from 0 to 1 with input a fixed at 0. Observe outputs at each change.",
  "scenario 7": "Toggle both input a and input b simultaneously from 0 to 1. Observe outputs after the changes.",
  "scenario 8": "Set inputs a and b to high impedance (if applicable in your simulator or setup) and observe outputs."
