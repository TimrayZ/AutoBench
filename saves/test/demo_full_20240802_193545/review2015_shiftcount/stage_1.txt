You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1. Since the full system doesn't ever use shift_ena and count_ena together, it does not matter what your circuit does if both control inputs are 1 (This mainly means that it doesn't matter which case gets higher priority).
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input shift_ena,
	input count_ena,
	input data,
	output reg [3:0] q);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

{
  "important data": "Build a four-bit shift register that acts as a down counter. It shifts data in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1, and decrements the value in the register when count_ena is 1. The two control signals are never asserted together, so their combined behavior is irrelevant.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: DUT Module Header: module top_module(input clk, input shift_ena, input count_ena, input data, output reg [3:0] q);",
    "2: The DUT is a 4-bit shift register.",
    "3: The output 'q' is a 4-bit register that holds the current state of the shift register and down counter.",
    "4: When shift_ena is asserted (1), the data is shifted into the register from the most significant bit (MSB).",
    "5: When count_ena is asserted (1), the value in the register is decremented by 1.",
    "6: The DUT does not have defined behavior when both shift_ena and count_ena are asserted.",
    "7: Timing considerations include clock edge sensitivity for the shift and count operations."
