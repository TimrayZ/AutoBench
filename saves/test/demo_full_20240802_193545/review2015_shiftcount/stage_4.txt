You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to complete a given verilog testbench code. This testbench is for a verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). This circuit is a sequential circuit. The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. test scenarios which determines values and sequential information of test vectors
- 1.4. the testbench structure
- 1.5. the instruction of writing our testbench

DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input shift_ena,
	input count_ena,
	input data,
	output reg [3:0] q);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter. Data is shifted in most-significant-bit first when shift_ena is 1. The number currently in the shift register is decremented when count_ena is 1. Since the full system doesn't ever use shift_ena and count_ena together, it does not matter what your circuit does if both control inputs are 1 (This mainly means that it doesn't matter which case gets higher priority).
IMPORTANT - test scenario (Please determine the values of input signals according to these test scenarios.):
{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the DUT with clk = 0, shift_ena = 0, count_ena = 0, data = 4'b0000. Apply a clock pulse (clk goes from 0 to 1) and wait for two clock cycles without asserting any control signals. This serves as the baseline test to check initial conditions.",
  "scenario 2": "Set shift_ena = 1 and data = 4'b1010. Apply a clock pulse (clk goes from 0 to 1) to shift the data into the register. Continue applying clock pulses for 3 cycles while keeping shift_ena = 1 and count_ena = 0 to observe the shifting behavior.",
  "scenario 3": "Set count_ena = 1 and assert the clock (clk goes from 0 to 1) while keeping shift_ena = 0. Continue applying clock pulses for 4 cycles to decrement the value in the register while observing the output.",
  "scenario 4": "Simultaneously assert shift_ena = 1 and count_ena = 1 to observe the behavior of the DUT when both control inputs are high; apply a clock pulse (clk goes from 0 to 1) and check output for 1 cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Set count_ena = 1 and initialize the register with a known value (like 4'b0011) by enabling the shift operation first for 1 cycle (shift_ena = 1, then set count_ena = 1). Apply clock pulses for 3 cycles to see the decrement behavior from a known state.",
  "scenario 6": "Change the data to a different 4-bit value (like 4'b1111) while shift_ena = 1 and count_ena = 0, then apply a clock pulse. Observe the register contents after shifting the new data in for 2 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 7": "Toggle the clk signal (go from 0 to 1, then 1 to 0, and back to 1) without changing shift_ena or count_ena to verify the register holds its value across clock edges when inactive."
}
below is the given testbench codes:
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module testbench;
reg  clk;
reg  shift_ena;
reg  count_ena;
reg  data;
wire [3:0] q;

integer file, scenario;
// DUT instantiation
top_module DUT (
	.clk(clk),
	.shift_ena(shift_ena),
	.count_ena(count_ena),
	.data(data),
	.q(q)
);
// Clock generation
initial begin
    clk = 0;
    forever #5 clk = ~clk;
end

initial begin
    file = $fopen("TBout.txt", "w");
end
// Scenario Based Test
initial begin

    // write your scenario checking codes here, according to scenario information

    $fclose(file);
    $finish;
end

endmodule


The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT. Please export the signals of DUT to a file named "TBout.txt" at the end of each scenario. The template is given below:
$fdisplay(file, "[check]scenario: %d, clk = %d, shift_ena = %d, count_ena = %d, data = %d, q = %d", scenario, clk, shift_ena, count_ena, data, q);
The variables are already declared. The clock signal is already prepared. This output will be used to check the correctness of the DUT's output later.
please only use "#10" as the delay when you need. If you need longer delay, you can use multiple "#10", such as "#10; #10; #10;". Avoid meaningless long delay in your code.
If you need a loop in a scenario to check multiple time points, use "repeat" loop. for exmaple:
```
// scenario x
scenario = x;
signal_1 = 1;
repeat(5) begin
    $fdisplay(file, "[check]scenario: %d, clk = %d, shift_ena = %d, count_ena = %d, data = %d, q = %d", scenario, clk, shift_ena, count_ena, data, q);
    #10;
end
```
Please determine the input signal's exact values according to given test scenarios. 
Note: please complete the last initial code part (marked in the given testbench template). You should give me the completed full code. The testbench template above is to help you generate the code. You must use %d when exporting values.
please generate the full testbench code. please only reply verilog codes, no other words.
