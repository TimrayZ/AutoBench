You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
The game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. 
// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say ""aaah!"". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.
// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)
// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground. Lemmings only splatter when hitting the ground; they do not splatter in mid-air.
// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "The Lemmings game involves a finite state machine where Lemmings can either walk left or right, fall, or dig based on the provided inputs. The state transitions follow certain prioritization rules: falling takes precedence over digging, which takes precedence over switching directions. The Lemming can splatter if it falls for more than 20 clock cycles and then hits the ground.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT is a Moore state machine that models Lemming behavior based on inputs: clk, areset, bump_left, bump_right, ground, and dig.",
    "2. The DUT outputs state signals for walking left (walk_left), walking right (walk_right), falling (aaah), and digging (digging).",
    "3. The behavior of the Lemming includes the following key actions: walking left or right depending on bumps, falling when there is no ground, starting to dig when the appropriate conditions are met, and splattering after falling beyond 20 clock cycles before hitting the ground.",
    "4. The state machine is reset using areset, which asynchronously sets the initial state for the Lemming to walk left.",
    "5. The timing for actions such as walking, falling, and digging is aligned with clock cycles, leveraging the rising edge of clk."

  "scenario 1": "Reset the system by asserting areset high for one clock cycle. This initializes the Lemming to walk left. After reset, maintain areset low for five clock cycles.",
  "scenario 2": "At clock cycle 6, deactivate bump_left and bump_right (set both to 0) while ground is high (1) and dig is low (0). Observe the walking direction (should be left).",
  "scenario 3": "At clock cycle 7, apply bump_right (set to 1) while ground is high (1) and dig is low (0). Observe that walking direction should switch to the right.",

  "scenario 5": "At clock cycle 9, set ground low (0) to make the Lemming fall. Confirm that it enters the falling state (aaah should be high).",
  "scenario 6": "At clock cycle 10, keep ground low (0) and activate bump_left (set to 1). Observe that the walking direction remains unaffected since the Lemming is falling.",
  "scenario 7": "At clock cycle 11, reassert ground high (1) after 2 clock cycles of falling and check if Lemming resumes walking in the original direction.",
  "scenario 8": "At clock cycle 12, set ground low (0) again to make the Lemming fall and let it fall for 21 clock cycles (cycles 12 to 32) to test the splatter condition.",
  "scenario 9": "At clock cycle 33, set ground high (1) to test the splatter condition; all outputs should remain inactive after hitting the ground.",
  "scenario 10": "At clock cycle 34, apply areset high for one clock cycle to reset the system. Observe that the Lemming again initializes to walk left."
