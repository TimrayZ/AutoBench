You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement a simple D flip flop with active high synchronous reset (reset output to 0).
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input d,
	input r,
	output logic q
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT is a D flip flop that captures the value of input 'd' on the rising edge of the clock 'clk' while considering an active high synchronous reset 'r'. If 'r' is asserted (high), the output 'q' will be reset to 0 regardless of the other inputs.",
    "2: The input signals to the DUT include 'clk' (clock signal), 'd' (data input), and 'r' (reset input). The output signal is 'q' (output of the flip flop).",
    "3: The testbench should generate clock cycles at a specific frequency to properly test the D flip flop functionality.",
    "4: The testbench must include test cases that cover the following scenarios: (a) Normal operation where 'r' is low, verify that 'q' follows 'd'; (b) Asserting 'r' to check if 'q' resets to 0; (c) Edge case tests such as having 'd' change right before the clock edge; (d) Multiple consecutive resets and toggles of 'd'; (e) Ensure that 'q' does not change when 'r' is asserted regardless of 'd'.",
    "5: The testbench should include assertions or checks after each clock cycle to validate the output 'q' against expected values based on the input signals."
