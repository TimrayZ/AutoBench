You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a two-bit saturating counter. The counter increments (up to a maximum of 3) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1. It decrements (down to a minimum of 0) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0. When not training (train_valid = 0), the counter keeps its value unchanged. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the counter to weakly not-taken (2'b01). Output state[1:0] is the two-bit counter value.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT is a two-bit saturating counter that increments and decrements based on the inputs train_valid and train_taken.",
    "2. The counter increments (up to 3) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 1.",
    "3. The counter decrements (down to 0) when train_valid = 1 and train_taken = 0.",
    "4. The counter retains its value unchanged when train_valid = 0.",
    "5. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the counter to 2'b01.",
    "6. The output state is a 2-bit value representing the counter."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input train_valid,
    input train_taken,
    output logic [1:0] state
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the DUT with areset=1 for one clock cycle to reset the counter to 2'b01. De-assert areset (aset=0) and allow the counter to stabilize for two clock cycles.",
  "scenario 2": "Set train_valid=1 and train_taken=1 for three consecutive clock cycles while observing the counter behavior.",
  "scenario 3": "Set train_valid=1 and train_taken=0 for three consecutive clock cycles to observe the decrementing behavior of the counter.",
  "scenario 4": "Set train_valid=0 for two clock cycles, ensuring the counter's value remains unchanged regardless of train_taken input during this period.",
  "scenario 5": "During the 4th clock cycle, assert areset=1 briefly (1 clock cycle) and then de-assert it to bring the counter back to 2'b01. Observe the behavior immediately after.",
  "scenario 6": "Set train_valid=1 and train_taken=1 for two clock cycles, then change train_taken to 0 for one clock cycle while train_valid remains high to switch between incrementing and decrementing.",
  "scenario 7": "Set train_valid=1 and train_taken=0, wait for two clock cycles, then set train_valid=0 for two cycles while toggling train_taken to ensure the counter does not change.",
  "scenario 8": "Simulate a scenario where train_valid=1 and train_taken=1 causes the counter to saturate at 3, followed by setting only train_valid=1 and train_taken=0 to observe the decrement to minimum."
