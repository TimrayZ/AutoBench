You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given the finite state machine circuit described below, assume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins.

// Build this circuit in Verilog.

// Input x goes to three different two-input gates: a XOR, an AND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of a D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input XNOR, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding flip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding flip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR is its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: The DUT is a finite state machine implementation using D flip-flops.",
    "1: The module header is 'module top_module (input clk, input x, output z);'.",
    "2: The circuit requires three two-input gates: a XOR gate, an AND gate, and an OR gate, fed by the input signal 'x'.",
    "3: Each gate is connected to the input of a D flip-flop, which is initially reset to zero.",
    "4: The output of each D flip-flop goes to a three-input XNOR gate whose output is 'z'.",
    "5: The second input of the XOR gate is the output of its corresponding D flip-flop.",
    "6: The second input of the AND gate is the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop.",
    "7: The second input of the OR gate is also the complemented output of its corresponding D flip-flop.",
    "8: The outputs from the flip-flops will be combined using a three-input XNOR gate to generate the output 'z'."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input x,
	output z
);

{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the simulation by driving the clock signal 'clk' to 0 and the input signal 'x' to 0. This should happen for at least 2 clock cycles, to ensure the D flip-flops are reset to zero.",
  "scenario 2": "At clock cycle 2, toggle the input 'x' to 1 and observe the outputs for one clock cycle (clk = 3).",
  "scenario 3": "At clock cycle 3, toggle 'x' back to 0 and maintain this state for two clock cycles (clk = 4, 5).",
  "scenario 4": "At clock cycle 5, toggle 'x' to 1 again and observe the outputs for one clock cycle (clk = 6).",
  "scenario 5": "At clock cycle 6, switch 'x' to 0 and monitor the response for three clock cycles (clk = 7, 8, 9).",
  "scenario 6": "At clock cycle 9, set 'x' to 1 again and maintain it for four clock cycles (clk = 10, 11, 12, 13), monitoring the output 'z' throughout.",
  "scenario 7": "At clock cycle 13, toggle 'x' back to 0 and observe how the system responds, checking the outputs for three clock cycles (clk = 14, 15, 16)."
