You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Consider this Verilog module "full_module":

// module full_module (
//     input [2:0] r,
//     input L,
//     input clk,
//     output reg [2:0] q
);

// always @(posedge clk) begin
//     if (L) begin
//         q <= r;
//     end else begin
//         q <= {q[1] ^ q[2], q[0], q[2]};
//     end
// end

// endmodule

// You want to create a hierarchical Verilog design where a flipflop and 2-1 multiplexer are in a submodule, and that submodule is instantiated three times in this code. Create the submodule called "top_module".

DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input L,
	input q_in,
	input r_in,
	output reg Q);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

{
  "important data": "The provided problem description and DUT header include a full module defined as 'full_module', which takes a 3-bit input 'r', a control signal 'L', a clock signal 'clk', and produces a 3-bit output 'q'. The DUT header describes another module named 'top_module', which takes inputs 'clk', 'L', 'q_in', and 'r_in', and outputs a single signal 'Q'.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT, 'top_module', includes the inputs: clk (clock), L (load signal), q_in (input signal), and r_in (input signal).",
    "2. The output 'Q' is a registered signal.",
    "3. The 'top_module' must instantiate the 'full_module' as the core functionality, which updates its output based on the value of 'L' and clock signal 'clk'.",
    "4. The testbench should generate test cases to verify the correct behavior of 'top_module', ensuring that when 'L' is high, 'Q' equals 'r_in', and otherwise follows the recursive behavior described for 'q' in 'full_module'.",
    "5. The testbench must verify edge cases including changes in the clock signal and transitions of the load signal."
