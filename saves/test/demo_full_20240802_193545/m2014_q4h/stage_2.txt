You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
The module assigns the output port to the same value as the input port combinationally.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT, named 'top_module', has one input port 'in' and one output port 'out'.",
    "2: The behavior of the DUT is to assign the input signal 'in' directly to the output signal 'out' combinationally.",
    "3: The expected behavior of the DUT is such that when 'in' is high (1), 'out' should also be high (1), and when 'in' is low (0), 'out' should also be low (0).",
    "4: The testbench will need to apply a sequence of test cases by driving the 'in' signal and monitoring the 'out' signal for correctness."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input in,
	output out);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

  "scenario 8": "Change 'in' to 1 at time = 11 clock cycles, hold for 1 clock cycle before ending the test."
