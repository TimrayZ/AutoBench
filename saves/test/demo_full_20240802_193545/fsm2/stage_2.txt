You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
This is a Moore state machine with two states, two inputs, and one output. Implement this state machine in Verilog. Reset is an active-high asynchronous reset to state OFF.

// OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF
// OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON
// ON (out=1) --k=0--> ON
// ON (out=1) --k=1--> OFF
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "// OFF (out=0) --j=0--> OFF\n// OFF (out=0) --j=1--> ON\n// ON (out=1) --k=0--> ON\n// ON (out=1) --k=1--> OFF",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: DUT module header: module top_module (input clk, input j, input k, input areset, output out)",
    "1: DUT has two states: OFF and ON.",
    "2: Active-high asynchronous reset (areset) to reset the state to OFF.",
    "3: DUT has two inputs: j and k.",
    "4: Expected output (out) is 0 when in OFF state and 1 when in ON state.",
    "5: Transitions: OFF -> OFF on j=0; OFF -> ON on j=1; ON -> ON on k=0; ON -> OFF on k=1."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input j,
	input k,
	input areset,
	output out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the DUT by setting areset to high for 1 clock cycle. After the first clock cycle, set areset to low.",
  "scenario 2": "Set j=0 and k=0 for 3 clock cycles, verifying that the output remains consistent.",
  "scenario 3": "Set j=1 for 1 clock cycle and check the system's response in the following clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set k=1 for 1 clock cycle while maintaining j=0 for the previous clock. Observe the output after this transition.",
  "scenario 5": "Set j=0 for 1 clock cycle, followed by j=1 for 1 clock cycle, and observe the changes in output over 3 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 6": "Set k=0 for 2 clock cycles while keeping j=1 from the previous test, and check if the output remains stable.",
  "scenario 7": "During clock cycle 1, set areset to high again to reset the state of the DUT, and then set areset to low after one clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Set both j=1 and k=1 for 1 clock cycle, and observe the output in the next clock cycle."
