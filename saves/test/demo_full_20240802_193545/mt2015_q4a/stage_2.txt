You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT implements the boolean function z = (x^y) & x.",
    "2. The module header specifies that there are two input signals: 'x' and 'y', both are of type wire or reg, and one output signal: 'z', which is also of type wire.",
    "3. The inputs 'x' and 'y' can be either 0 or 1, and 'z' will be the result of the boolean operation defined.",
    "4. The testbench must provide all possible combinations of inputs x and y (00, 01, 10, 11) to verify the correctness of the DUT.",
    "5. The expected output 'z' must be calculated based on the input values to verify if the DUT produces the correct results."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input x,
	input y,
	output z);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Set x = 0 and y = 0 for one clock cycle. After one clock cycle, check the output z.",
  "scenario 2": "Set x = 0 and y = 1 for one clock cycle. After one clock cycle, check the output z.",
  "scenario 3": "Set x = 1 and y = 0 for one clock cycle. After one clock cycle, check the output z.",
  "scenario 4": "Set x = 1 and y = 1 for one clock cycle. After one clock cycle, check the output z."
