You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs are given as "(out1, out2)"):

// S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1
// S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2
// S2 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S2 (0, 0) --1--> S3
// S3 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4
// S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5
// S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8
// S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6
// S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9
// S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7
// S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0
// S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7
// S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0
// S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1
// S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0
// S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1

// Suppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through state[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs are zero unless otherwise specified.

// Write Verilog implementing the state transition logic and output logic portions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are given the current state in state[9:0] and must produce next_state[9:0] and the two outputs. Derive the logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "// State Machine Transition Table\n" 
                		, 
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Input Signals: \n   - in: 1-bit binary input signal.\n   - state: 10-bit one-hot encoded state signal, representing the current state (state[0] through state[9] for S0 through S9).",
    "2. DUT Output Signals: \n   - next_state: 10-bit one-hot encoded signal representing the next state based on the current state and input.\n   - out1: 1-bit output signal that may vary depending on the state machine logic.\n   - out2: 1-bit output signal that may vary depending on the state machine logic.",
    "3. State Machine Logic: \n   - The state transitions are dictated by the current state and the input signal according to the given state transition logic.",
    "4. Testbench Requirements: \n   - Generate multiple test cases for all input combinations (0 and 1 for 'in') while varying the state to ensure all transitions and outputs of the DUT are tested. \n   - Check if the output next_state, out1, and out2 matched the expected results specified in the transition table.",
    "5. Expected Results: \n   - Define expected next_state and output values (out1, out2) for each combination of current state and input to validate DUT correctness."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input in,
	input [9:0] state,
	output [9:0] next_state,
	output out1,
	output out2);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that.
