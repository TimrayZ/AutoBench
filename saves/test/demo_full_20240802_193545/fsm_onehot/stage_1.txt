You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given the follow state machine with 1 input and 2 outputs (the outputs are given as "(out1, out2)"):

// S0 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S0 (0, 0) --1--> S1
// S1 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S1 (0, 0) --1--> S2
// S2 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S2 (0, 0) --1--> S3
// S3 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S3 (0, 0) --1--> S4
// S4 (0, 0) --0--> S0
// S4 (0, 0) --1--> S5
// S5 (0, 0) --0--> S8
// S5 (0, 0) --1--> S6
// S6 (0, 0) --0--> S9
// S6 (0, 0) --1--> S7
// S7 (0, 1) --0--> S0
// S7 (0, 1) --1--> S7
// S8 (1, 0) --0--> S0
// S8 (1, 0) --1--> S1
// S9 (1, 1) --0--> S0
// S9 (1, 1) --1--> S1

// Suppose this state machine uses one-hot encoding, where state[0] through state[9] correspond to the states S0 though S9, respectively. The outputs are zero unless otherwise specified.

// Write Verilog implementing the state transition logic and output logic portions of the state machine (but not the state flip-flops). You are given the current state in state[9:0] and must produce next_state[9:0] and the two outputs. Derive the logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding.
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input in,
	input [9:0] state,
	output [9:0] next_state,
	output out1,
	output out2);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Input Signals: \n   - in: 1-bit binary input signal.\n   - state: 10-bit one-hot encoded state signal, representing the current state (state[0] through state[9] for S0 through S9).",
    "2. DUT Output Signals: \n   - next_state: 10-bit one-hot encoded signal representing the next state based on the current state and input.\n   - out1: 1-bit output signal that may vary depending on the state machine logic.\n   - out2: 1-bit output signal that may vary depending on the state machine logic.",
    "3. State Machine Logic: \n   - The state transitions are dictated by the current state and the input signal according to the given state transition logic.",
    "4. Testbench Requirements: \n   - Generate multiple test cases for all input combinations (0 and 1 for 'in') while varying the state to ensure all transitions and outputs of the DUT are tested. \n   - Check if the output next_state, out1, and out2 matched the expected results specified in the transition table.",
    "5. Expected Results: \n   - Define expected next_state and output values (out1, out2) for each combination of current state and input to validate DUT correctness."
