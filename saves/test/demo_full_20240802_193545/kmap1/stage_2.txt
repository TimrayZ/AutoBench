You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map below.
//        a
// bc   0 1 
//  00 | 0 | 1 |
//  01 | 1 | 1 | 
//  11 | 1 | 1 | 
//  10 | 1 | 1 | 

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "The Karnaugh map represents the boolean function for three inputs a, b, and c, where the output 'out' is true (1) for the combinations of inputs as follows: (b=0, c=1) -> 1, (b=1, c=0) -> 1, (b=1, c=1) -> 1, (b=0, c=0) -> 0.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT inputs: three single-bit inputs a, b, c.",
    "2. DUT output: one single-bit output out.",
    "3. The output out should be 1 for the following combinations of inputs: (a=0, b=0, c=1), (a=0, b=1, c=0), (a=1, b=0, c=1), (a=1, b=1, c=0), (a=1, b=1, c=1).",
    "4. The output out should be 0 for the input combination (a=0, b=0, c=0).",
    "5. The testbench should iterate over all possible combinations of inputs (2^3 = 8 combinations).",
    "6. For each combination of inputs, the testbench should compare the DUT output with the expected output derived from the Karnaugh map."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input a, 
	input b,
	input c,
	output out
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
