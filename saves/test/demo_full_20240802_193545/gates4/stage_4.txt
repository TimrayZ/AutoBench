You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, out_and = %d, out_or = %d, out_xor = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, out_and = %d, out_or = %d, out_xor = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, out_and = %d, out_or = %d, out_xor = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input [3:0] in,
	output out_and,
	output out_or,
	output out_xor
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a combinational circuit with four inputs, in[3:0]. There are 3 outputs: 
// (1) out_and: output of a 4-input AND gate. 
// (2) out_or: output of a 4-input OR gate. 
// (3) out_xor: output of a 4-input XOR gate.

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Name: top_module",
    "2. Inputs: 4-bit vector 'in' (in[3:0])",
    "3. Outputs: 1-bit 'out_and', 1-bit 'out_or', 1-bit 'out_xor'",
    "4. Functionality: The module implements the following combinational logic: out_and is the AND of all inputs, out_or is the OR of all inputs, and out_xor is the XOR of all inputs.",
    "5. Expected behavior: The testbench should provide various combinations of 4-bit input and verify that out_and, out_or, and out_xor match the expected results based on combinational logic."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set in = 4'b0000; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set in = 4'b1111; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Set in = 4'b1010; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set in = 4'b0101; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Set in = 4'b0011; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Set in = 4'b1100; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 7": "Set in = 4'b1001; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Set in = 4'b0110; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 9": "Set in = 4'b1011; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 10": "Set in = 4'b0111; Apply stimulus and wait for 1 clock cycle."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".

(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
