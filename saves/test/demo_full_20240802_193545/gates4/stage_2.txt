You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a combinational circuit with four inputs, in[3:0]. There are 3 outputs: 
// (1) out_and: output of a 4-input AND gate. 
// (2) out_or: output of a 4-input OR gate. 
// (3) out_xor: output of a 4-input XOR gate.

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Name: top_module",
    "2. Inputs: 4-bit vector 'in' (in[3:0])",
    "3. Outputs: 1-bit 'out_and', 1-bit 'out_or', 1-bit 'out_xor'",
    "4. Functionality: The module implements the following combinational logic: out_and is the AND of all inputs, out_or is the OR of all inputs, and out_xor is the XOR of all inputs.",
    "5. Expected behavior: The testbench should provide various combinations of 4-bit input and verify that out_and, out_or, and out_xor match the expected results based on combinational logic."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [3:0] in,
	output out_and,
	output out_or,
	output out_xor
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}
