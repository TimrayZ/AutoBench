You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a 6-to-1 multiplexer. When sel is between 0 and 5, choose the corresponding data input. Otherwise, output 0. The data inputs and outputs are all 4 bits wide.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "DUT header: module top_module (\n\tinput [2:0] sel,\n\tinput [3:0] data0,\n\tinput [3:0] data1,\n\tinput [3:0] data2,\n\tinput [3:0] data3,\n\tinput [3:0] data4,\n\tinput [3:0] data5,\n\toutput reg [3:0] out\n);",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: DUT functionality is to implement a 6-to-1 multiplexer.",
    "1: Input signals include a 3-bit select signal (sel) and six 4-bit data inputs (data0, data1, data2, data3, data4, data5).",
    "2: The output signal is a 4-bit wide output (out).",
    "3: When sel is between 0 and 5, out should be assigned the value from the corresponding data input; when sel is greater than 5, out should be set to 0.",
    "4: Testbench must simulate all possible sel values from 0 to 7 for comprehensive testing (0-5 for valid data selections and 6-7 for invalid selections).",
    "5: Each test case should check for both the expected output for valid sel values and verify that the output is 0 for sel values of 6 and 7."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [2:0] sel,
	input [3:0] data0,
	input [3:0] data1,
	input [3:0] data2,
	input [3:0] data3,
	input [3:0] data4,
	input [3:0] data5,
	output reg [3:0] out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:

  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
