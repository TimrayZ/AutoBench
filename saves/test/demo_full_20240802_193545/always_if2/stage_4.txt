You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, cpu_overheated = %d, shut_off_computer = %d, arrived = %d, gas_tank_empty = %d, keep_driving = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, cpu_overheated = %d, shut_off_computer = %d, arrived = %d, gas_tank_empty = %d, keep_driving = %d", "scenario: 1b, cpu_overheated = %d, shut_off_computer = %d, arrived = %d, gas_tank_empty = %d, keep_driving = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input cpu_overheated,
	output reg shut_off_computer,
	input arrived,
	input gas_tank_empty,
	output reg keep_driving
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Fix any and all bugs in this code:

// module top_module (
//     input      cpu_overheated,
//     output reg shut_off_computer,
//     input      arrived,
//     input      gas_tank_empty,
//     output reg keep_driving  ); //

//     always @(*) begin
//         if (cpu_overheated)
//            shut_off_computer = 1;
//     end

//     always @(*) begin
//         if (~arrived)
//            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;
//     end

// endmodule

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT is a module named 'top_module' that has 4 input signals: 'cpu_overheated', 'arrived', and 'gas_tank_empty'. It has 2 output signals: 'shut_off_computer' and 'keep_driving'.",
    "2. The output 'shut_off_computer' should be set to 1 when 'cpu_overheated' is true (1).",
    "3. The output 'keep_driving' should be set to the negation of 'gas_tank_empty' when 'arrived' is false (0).",
    "4. The module makes use of always blocks triggered by any change in the input signals.",
    "5. The expected behavior of the DUT must be validated against various test cases including all possible combinations of input signal values."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 2": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 0 (false), 'arrived' to 1 (true), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 1 (true) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 3": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 0 (false), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 4": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 1 (true), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 5": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 0 (false), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 1 (true) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 6": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 1 (true) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 7": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 0 (false), 'arrived' to 1 (true), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 1 (true) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 8": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 1 (true), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 1 (true) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 9": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 2 clock cycles, changing 'arrived' to 1 (true) in between the cycles. Then check outputs."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".

please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
