please check the if the testbench code above contains all the scenarios in the checklist:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 2": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 0 (false), 'arrived' to 1 (true), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 1 (true) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 3": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 0 (false), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",
  "scenario 4": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 1 (true), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 1 clock cycle. Then check outputs.",

  "scenario 9": "Set 'cpu_overheated' to 1 (true), 'arrived' to 0 (false), and 'gas_tank_empty' to 0 (false) for 2 clock cycles, changing 'arrived' to 1 (true) in between the cycles. Then check outputs."
}
please reply 'YES' if all the items are included. If some of the items are missed in testbench, please add the missing items and reply the modified testbench code (full code).
VERY IMPORTANT: please ONLY reply 'YES' or the full code modified. NEVER remove other irrelevant codes!!!
