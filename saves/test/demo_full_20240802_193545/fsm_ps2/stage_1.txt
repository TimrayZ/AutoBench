You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. However, within a continuous byte stream, it's not obvious where messages start and end. The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received. Reset should be active high synchronous.
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	input reset,
	output done
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

{
  "important data": "The PS/2 mouse protocol sends messages that are three bytes long. The first byte of each message has in[3]=1, which indicates the start of a message. The DUT processes a continuous byte stream and must signal 'done' after successfully receiving three bytes.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT (Device Under Test) is a finite state machine that finds message boundaries in the PS/2 mouse protocol byte stream.",
    "2. The DUT has the following input ports: 'clk' (clock signal), 'in' (an 8-bit input byte), and 'reset' (active high synchronous reset).",
    "3. The DUT has one output port: 'done', which indicates that a complete message of three bytes has been received.",
    "4. The DUT must discard bytes until a byte is received with in[3] = 1, marking the start of a message.",
    "5. The DUT must signal 'done' immediately after the third byte of a message has been received.",
    "6. The reset signal should reset the state machine synchronously, ensuring proper initialization."
