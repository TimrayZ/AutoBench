You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Synchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a "flag" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing "flags", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:

// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).
// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).
// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).

// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0. The reset signal is active high synchronous. The output signals should be asserted for a complete cycle beginning on the clock cycle after the condition occurs.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: The DUT is a Moore-type finite state machine that detects specific bit patterns in a continuous bit stream.",
    "1: The DUT has the following input signals: clk (clock), reset (active high synchronous reset), in (input bit stream).",
    "2: The DUT has the following output signals: disc (asserted when a bit needs to be discarded), flag (asserted at the start/end of a frame), and err (asserted when there are 7 or more consecutive 1s).",
    "3: The DUT must recognize three sequences: 0111110 (output 'disc'), 01111110 (output 'flag'), and 01111111... (output 'err').",
    "4: The state of the DUT must reset to treat the last input as a 0 upon receiving a reset signal.",
    "5: The outputs should be asserted for a complete cycle starting on the clock cycle immediately following the condition."

  "scenario 1": "Reset the DUT by asserting reset high for 1 clock cycle (clk cycle 0). Release the reset (set reset low) at clock cycle 1. Then, apply the input sequence 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 (for clock cycles 2 to 8) to check if the disc output is asserted correctly after detecting 0111110.",
  "scenario 2": "After the previous test, keep applying the input sequence 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 (for clock cycles 9 to 16) to check if the flag output is asserted correctly at the end of the sequence of 01111110.",
  "scenario 3": "Reset the DUT again by asserting reset high for 1 clock cycle (clk cycle 17). Release the reset (set reset low) at clock cycle 18. Apply a continuous sequence of 1s for 8 clock cycles (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) during clock cycles 19 to 26 to check if the err output is asserted correctly due to the detection of 7 consecutive 1s.",
  "scenario 4": "After the error test, apply the input sequence 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 (for clock cycles 27 to 33) immediately to check if the disc signal is asserted after detecting the 0111110 pattern, ensuring the FSM recovers correctly post-error.",
  "scenario 5": "Perform a longer sequence test by applying 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 followed by 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 (for clock cycles 34 to 51) to check various transitions and to affirm that the system behaves correctly across multiple patterns, ensuring no erroneous outputs are produced."
