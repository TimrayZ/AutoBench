You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create 16 D flip-flops. It's sometimes useful to only modify parts of a group of flip-flops. The byte-enable inputs control whether each byte of the 16 registers should be written to on that cycle. byteena[1] controls the upper byte d[15:8], while byteena[0] controls the lower byte d[7:0]. resetn is a synchronous, active-low reset. All DFFs should be triggered by the positive edge of clk.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT is a module that implements 16 D flip-flops with additional byte-enable functionality.",
    "2. The DUT has the following inputs: clk (clock signal), resetn (active-low synchronous reset), byteena (2-bit input for byte enable), and d (16-bit data input).",
    "3. The DUT has one output: q, which is a 16-bit register output that holds the values of the D flip-flops.",
    "4. The byteena[1] input controls writing to the upper byte of the flip-flops (d[15:8]), while byteena[0] controls the lower byte (d[7:0]).",
    "5. The DUT's behavior is that on the positive edge of clk, if resetn is low, all flip-flops are reset; otherwise, only the selected bytes of the D input (based on byteena) are written to the corresponding flip-flops.",
    "6. The DUT requires testing for both the reset functionality and proper byte-enable functionality for varying input conditions."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input resetn,
	input [1:0] byteena,
	input [15:0] d,
	output reg [15:0] q);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:

{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the DUT by asserting resetn low for one clock cycle (clk=0 to clk=1). Then, deassert resetn (set resetn high) and verify the state of the output q to ensure all flip-flops are reset.",
  "scenario 2": "Set resetn high and apply a 16-bit data input d = 16'hA5A5. Use byteena = 2'b01 to enable writing to the lower byte (d[7:0]). Wait for one clock cycle (clk=1) and then verify the output q for the expected value.",
  "scenario 3": "Set resetn high and apply data input d = 16'hFF00. Use byteena = 2'b10 to enable writing to the upper byte (d[15:8]). Wait for one clock cycle (clk=1) and then verify the output q for the expected value.",
  "scenario 4": "Set resetn high and apply both byteena = 2'b11 and data d = 16'hF0F0. This should write to both upper and lower bytes on the next clock edge (clk=1). Wait for one clock cycle and verify the output q.",
  "scenario 5": "Perform a sequence of actions by first asserting resetn low and then deasserting it. After that, apply data d = 16'h1234 with byteena = 2'b01, and observe the output q after one clock cycle, followed by applying d = 16'h5678 with byteena = 2'b10 on the next clock (clk=2) and observing q again.",
  "scenario 6": "Apply random values to d with all possible byteena combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) for multiple clock cycles (from clk=0 to clk=4) after deasserting resetn to check the writing functionality on the corresponding parts of the flip-flops.",
  "scenario 7": "Assert resetn low, wait for two clock cycles (clk=0 to clk=2), then deassert resetn, and apply data d = 16'hAAAA with byteena = 2'b00. Wait for one clock cycle and verify that the output q holds the expected value after reset.",
  "scenario 8": "Change byteena from 2'b00 to 2'b01 while applying a constant data input (e.g., d = 16'hBEEF) over multiple clock cycles (clk=0 to clk=5) and observe the output q output each time after the cycle ends."
