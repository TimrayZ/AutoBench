You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given a 100-bit input vector [99:0], reverse its bit ordering.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Given a 100-bit input vector [99:0], reverse its bit ordering.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Header: The module is defined as 'top_module' with one 100-bit input 'in' and one 100-bit output 'out'.",
    "2. Input Requirements: The input signal 'in' is a 100-bit vector where the bits are indexed from 99 down to 0.",
    "3. Output Requirements: The output signal 'out' must be a 100-bit vector representing the bit-reversed order of the input signal 'in'. For example, if 'in' = 100'b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, then 'out' must be '100'b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.",
    "4. Functional Requirement: The DUT must correctly reverse the ordering of all bits from the input vector.",
    "5. Testbench Purpose: The testbench will apply test vectors to the input 'in' of the DUT, check the output 'out', and compare it with expected results to validate the functionality of the DUT."

DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [99:0] in,
	output reg [99:0] out
);
