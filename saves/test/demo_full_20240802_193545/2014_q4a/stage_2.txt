You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Consider an n-bit shift register circuit. Inputs E are for enabling shift, R for value to load, L is asserted when it should load, and w is the input to the first stage of the shift register. Write a Verilog module named top_module for one stage of this circuit, including both the flip-flop and multiplexers.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT is a n-bit shift register circuit.",
    "2. Inputs: clk (clock signal), w (input to the first stage), R (value to load), E (enable shift), L (load signal).",
    "3. Output: Q (the current value at the output of the flip-flop).",
    "4. The module name of the DUT is 'top_module'.",
    "5. When L is asserted, the value of R should be loaded into the shift register output Q.",
    "6. When E is asserted, the input w should be shifted into the register, moving the current contents of Q to the next stage."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input w,
	input R,
	input E,
	input L,
	output reg Q
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Initial setup - apply reset condition by driving L high while keeping E low, then release L after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Load a value into the shift register - set L high and R to the desired value, observe the value loaded on the next clock edge. L should go low after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Shift operation - set E high and w to a new value. Observe the shifting operation occurring over 3 clock cycles with the input w changing on the first clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Test with continuous shifting - keep E high and provide different values for w every clock cycle for 5 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 5": "Load a value again while shifting - set E high and provide new values for w for 2 clock cycles, then assert L high for 1 clock cycle with R as a new value. L goes low after this clock cycle and observe the state.",
  "scenario 6": "Disable shifting - set E low after holding it high for 3 clock cycles, then observe the output Q holds without change for 2 clock cycles while E remains low.",
  "scenario 7": "Test edge case for enable signal - set E and L together and switch L off after 1 clock cycle while observing output Q.",
  "scenario 8": "Interrupt the load operation by asserting E during L, set L high for 2 clock cycles while E is also high, then deassert L."
