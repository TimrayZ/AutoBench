You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement the following circuit in Verilog. Two inputs (in1 and in2) go to an AND gate, but the in2 input to the AND gate has a bubble. The output of the AND gate is connected to 'out'.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT module is named 'top_module' and has two inputs: 'in1' (logic) and 'in2' (logic).",
    "2. The output of the DUT is 'out' (logic).",
    "3. The circuit implements an AND gate where 'in2' has a bubble (inverted input) before reaching the AND gate. Therefore, the effective operation being performed is: out = in1 AND (NOT in2).",
    "4. Testbench should apply various combinations of 'in1' and 'in2' inputs to verify the output behavior against the expected output."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input in1,
	input in2,
	output logic out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}
