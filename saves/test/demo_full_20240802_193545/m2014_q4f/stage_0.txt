Please generate the verilog RTL code according to the following description and header information:
problem description:
Implement the following circuit in Verilog. Two inputs (in1 and in2) go to an AND gate, but the in2 input to the AND gate has a bubble. The output of the AND gate is connected to 'out'.
RTL header:
module top_module (
	input in1,
	input in2,
	output logic out
);

please only reply verilog codes. reply_format:
```verilog

```verilog
module top_module (
    input in1,
    input in2,
    output logic out
);
    // The bubble indicates a NOT operation on in2
    logic not_in2;
    
    // NOT gate for in2
    assign not_in2 = ~in2;
    
    // AND gate with in1 and not_in2
    assign out = in1 & not_in2;
endmodule
```
