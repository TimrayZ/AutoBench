You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input in,
	input [3:0] state,
	output reg [3:0] next_state,
	output out
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following one-hot state encoding: A=4'b0001, B=4'b0010, C=4'b0100, D=4'b1000. Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. 
// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
// A | A, B | 0
// B | C, B | 0
// C | A, D | 0
// D | C, B | 1
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output\n// A | A, B | 0\n// B | C, B | 0\n// C | A, D | 0\n// D | C, B | 1",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: The DUT is a Moore state machine with one input and one output and accepts a 4-bit one-hot encoded state.",
    "1: The module has the following ports - input: 'in' (1-bit), input: 'state' (4 bits), output: 'next_state' (4 bits), output: 'out' (1 bit).",
    "2: The following state transitions are specified: For state A, if in=0, next_state remains A; if in=1, next_state becomes B and output is 0; For state B, if in=0, next_state becomes C; if in=1, next_state remains B and output is 0; For state C, if in=0, next_state becomes A; if in=1, next_state becomes D and output is 0; For state D, if in=0, next_state becomes C; if in=1, next_state becomes B and output is 1.",
    "3: The expected output for states A, B, C, D will be 0 for states A, B, and C, and 1 for state D under the condition of in=1.",
    "4: The testbench must include test cases for all transitions based on the input variations and validate the corresponding output based on the current state."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the state to A (4'b0001) and apply in=0. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set state to A (4'b0001) and apply in=1. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Set state to B (4'b0010) and apply in=0. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set state to B (4'b0010) and apply in=1. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Set state to C (4'b0100) and apply in=0. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Set state to C (4'b0100) and apply in=1. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 7": "Set state to D (4'b1000) and apply in=0. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Set state to D (4'b1000) and apply in=1. Observe the next_state and output after 1 clock cycle."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
