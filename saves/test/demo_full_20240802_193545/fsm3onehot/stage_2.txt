You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following one-hot state encoding: A=4'b0001, B=4'b0010, C=4'b0100, D=4'b1000. Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. 
// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
// A | A, B | 0
// B | C, B | 0
// C | A, D | 0
// D | C, B | 1
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output\n// A | A, B | 0\n// B | C, B | 0\n// C | A, D | 0\n// D | C, B | 1",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: The DUT is a Moore state machine with one input and one output and accepts a 4-bit one-hot encoded state.",
    "1: The module has the following ports - input: 'in' (1-bit), input: 'state' (4 bits), output: 'next_state' (4 bits), output: 'out' (1 bit).",
    "2: The following state transitions are specified: For state A, if in=0, next_state remains A; if in=1, next_state becomes B and output is 0; For state B, if in=0, next_state becomes C; if in=1, next_state remains B and output is 0; For state C, if in=0, next_state becomes A; if in=1, next_state becomes D and output is 0; For state D, if in=0, next_state becomes C; if in=1, next_state becomes B and output is 1.",
    "3: The expected output for states A, B, C, D will be 0 for states A, B, and C, and 1 for state D under the condition of in=1.",
    "4: The testbench must include test cases for all transitions based on the input variations and validate the corresponding output based on the current state."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input in,
	input [3:0] state,
	output reg [3:0] next_state,
	output out
);
