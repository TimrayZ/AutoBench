You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module(
	input in,
	output out);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT is defined as a module named 'top_module' with one input named 'in' and one output named 'out'.",
    "2. The DUT is required to have behavior equivalent to a wire, meaning the output 'out' should directly reflect the value of the input 'in'.",
    "3. The DUT must handle all possible input scenarios, such as an input of 0 and 1.",
    "4. The behavior of the DUT should be tested against the expected outputs for each input case to determine if the DUT operates correctly."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Apply a logical low value (0) to the input 'in' at time 0 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 2": "Apply a logical high value (1) to the input 'in' at time 10 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 3": "Change the input 'in' from a logical low (0) to a logical high (1) at time 20 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 4": "Change the input 'in' from a logical high (1) to a logical low (0) at time 30 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply a sequence of alternating values: Start with a logical low (0) at time 40 ns, switch to high (1) at 42 ns, low (0) at 44 ns, and high (1) at 46 ns. Hold each value for 2 clock cycles."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
