You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT is defined as a module named 'top_module' with one input named 'in' and one output named 'out'.",
    "2. The DUT is required to have behavior equivalent to a wire, meaning the output 'out' should directly reflect the value of the input 'in'.",
    "3. The DUT must handle all possible input scenarios, such as an input of 0 and 1.",
    "4. The behavior of the DUT should be tested against the expected outputs for each input case to determine if the DUT operates correctly."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input in,
	output out);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Apply a logical low value (0) to the input 'in' at time 0 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 2": "Apply a logical high value (1) to the input 'in' at time 10 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 3": "Change the input 'in' from a logical low (0) to a logical high (1) at time 20 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 4": "Change the input 'in' from a logical high (1) to a logical low (0) at time 30 ns. Hold this value for 10 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply a sequence of alternating values: Start with a logical low (0) at time 40 ns, switch to high (1) at 42 ns, low (0) at 44 ns, and high (1) at 46 ns. Hold each value for 2 clock cycles."
