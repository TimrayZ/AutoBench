You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input in,
	input [1:0] state,
	output reg [1:0] next_state,
	output out
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following state encoding: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. Given the current state (state), compute the next_state and output (out) based on the state transition table.
// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
// A | A, B | 0
// B | C, B | 0
// C | A, D | 0
// D | C, B | 1
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output\nA | A, B | 0\nB | C, B | 0\nC | A, D | 0\nD | C, B | 1",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT (top_module) has an input 'in' (1-bit) and the current state is represented by 'state' (2 bits).",
    "2: The output 'out' is 1 bit, which is influenced by the current state and input.",
    "3: The output 'next_state' represents the next state of the state machine (2 bits).",
    "4: The state encoding is as follows: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.",
    "5: The testbench should generate various test cases covering all possible transitions based on the input 'in' and the current state.",
    "6: The testbench needs to check the expected output 'next_state' and 'out' based on provided state transition table."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Initial state is A (state=2'b00) with input in=0. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 2": "Current state is A (state=2'b00) with input in=1. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 3": "Current state is B (state=2'b01) with input in=0. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 4": "Current state is B (state=2'b01) with input in=1. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 5": "Current state is C (state=2'b10) with input in=0. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 6": "Current state is C (state=2'b10) with input in=1. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 7": "Current state is D (state=2'b11) with input in=0. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output.",
  "scenario 8": "Current state is D (state=2'b11) with input in=1. Wait for 1 clock cycle and check the output."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, state = %d, next_state = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
