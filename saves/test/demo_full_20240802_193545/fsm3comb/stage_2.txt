You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following state encoding: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine. Given the current state (state), compute the next_state and output (out) based on the state transition table.
// State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
// A | A, B | 0
// B | C, B | 0
// C | A, D | 0
// D | C, B | 1
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output\nA | A, B | 0\nB | C, B | 0\nC | A, D | 0\nD | C, B | 1",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT (top_module) has an input 'in' (1-bit) and the current state is represented by 'state' (2 bits).",
    "2: The output 'out' is 1 bit, which is influenced by the current state and input.",
    "3: The output 'next_state' represents the next state of the state machine (2 bits).",
    "4: The state encoding is as follows: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.",
    "5: The testbench should generate various test cases covering all possible transitions based on the input 'in' and the current state.",
    "6: The testbench needs to check the expected output 'next_state' and 'out' based on provided state transition table."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input in,
	input [1:0] state,
	output reg [1:0] next_state,
	output out
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
