You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, x3 = %d, x2 = %d, x1 = %d, f = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, x3 = %d, x2 = %d, x1 = %d, f = %d", "scenario: 1b, x3 = %d, x2 = %d, x1 = %d, f = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input x3,
	input x2,
	input x1,
	output f
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a combinational circuit that implements the truth table.

// x3 | x2 | x1 | f
// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
// 0 | 0 | 1 | 0
// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1
// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1
// 1 | 1 | 0 | 0
// 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Truth table for the combinational circuit implementation: // x3 | x2 | x1 | f // 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 // 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 // 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 // 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 // 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 // 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 // 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 // 1 | 1 | 1 | 1",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: DUT module header: module top_module ( input x3, input x2, input x1, output f );",
    "2: DUT is a combinational circuit that implements the provided truth table.",
    "3: The input signals are x3, x2, and x1; they are binary inputs (0 or 1).",
    "4: The output signal f is a binary output corresponding to the truth table.",
    "5: Testbench must apply all possible combinations of input signals (0 and 1 for x3, x2, x1), which totals to 8 combinations.",
    "6: Expected output f values according to the truth table for each combination must be compared against actual output from DUT to verify correctness."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Apply inputs x3 = 0, x2 = 0, x1 = 0 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Apply inputs x3 = 0, x2 = 0, x1 = 1 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Apply inputs x3 = 0, x2 = 1, x1 = 0 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Apply inputs x3 = 0, x2 = 1, x1 = 1 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply inputs x3 = 1, x2 = 0, x1 = 0 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Apply inputs x3 = 1, x2 = 0, x1 = 1 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 7": "Apply inputs x3 = 1, x2 = 1, x1 = 0 for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Apply inputs x3 = 1, x2 = 1, x1 = 1 for 1 clock cycle."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, x3 = %d, x2 = %d, x1 = %d, f = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, x3 = %d, x2 = %d, x1 = %d, f = %d", "scenario: 1b, x3 = %d, x2 = %d, x1 = %d, f = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
