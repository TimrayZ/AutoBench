You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a combinational circuit that implements the truth table.

// x3 | x2 | x1 | f
// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
// 0 | 0 | 1 | 0
// 0 | 1 | 0 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1
// 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
// 1 | 0 | 1 | 1
// 1 | 1 | 0 | 0
// 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Truth table for the combinational circuit implementation: // x3 | x2 | x1 | f // 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 // 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 // 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 // 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 // 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 // 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 // 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 // 1 | 1 | 1 | 1",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: DUT module header: module top_module ( input x3, input x2, input x1, output f );",
    "2: DUT is a combinational circuit that implements the provided truth table.",
    "3: The input signals are x3, x2, and x1; they are binary inputs (0 or 1).",
    "4: The output signal f is a binary output corresponding to the truth table.",
    "5: Testbench must apply all possible combinations of input signals (0 and 1 for x3, x2, x1), which totals to 8 combinations.",
    "6: Expected output f values according to the truth table for each combination must be compared against actual output from DUT to verify correctness."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input x3,
	input x2,
	input x1,
	output f
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
