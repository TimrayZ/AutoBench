You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a 32-bit global history shift register, including support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush caused by a branch misprediction. When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the direction of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs (train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the history after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence, because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the history counter to zero.


DUT header:
module top_module
(
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input predict_valid,
    input predict_taken,
    output logic [31:0] predict_history,
    
    input train_mispredicted,
    input train_taken,
    input [31:0] train_history
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT is a 32-bit global history shift register that updates its state based on branch predictions and mispredictions.",
    "2. The DUT has the following inputs: clk (clock signal), areset (asynchronous reset), predict_valid (indicates if the prediction is valid), predict_taken (indicates the predicted branch direction), train_mispredicted (indicates if a branch misprediction occurred), train_taken (actual result of the branch), and train_history (history before the mispredicted branch).",
    "3. The DUT outputs predict_history, a 32-bit logic vector representing the current branch history.",
    "4. The DUT's behavior is governed by the following rules: when predict_valid is 1, predict_taken is shifted in from the LSB, updating predict_history; if train_mispredicted is 1, predict_history is loaded with train_history concatenated with train_taken; if both predict_valid and train_mispredicted are high, the former is disregarded in favor of the latter.",
    "5. The asynchronous reset (areset) resets the history to zero on the rising edge of the clock."
