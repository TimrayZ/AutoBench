You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given the following Moore state machine with 3 input (d, done_counting, ack) and 3 outputs (shift_ena, counting, done). Unless otherwise stated in the diagram below, assume outputs are 0 and inputs are don't cares.

// S () --d=0--> S
// S () --d=1--> S1
// S1 () --d=0--> S
// S1 () --d=1--> S11
// S11 () --d=0--> S110
// S11 () --d=1--> S11
// S110 () --d=0--> S
// S110 () --d=1--> B0
// B0 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> B1
// B1 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> B2
// B2 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> B3
// B3 (shift_ena=1) -- (always go to next cycle) --> Count
// Count (counting=1) --!(done_counting)--> Count
// Count (counting=1) --(done_counting)--> Wait
// Wait (done=1) --ack=0--> Wait
// Wait (done=1) --ack=1--> S

// At reset, the state machine starts in state "S". Derive next-state logic equations and output logic equations by inspection assuming the following one-hot encoding is used: (S, S1, S11, S110, B0, B1, B2, B3, Count, Wait) = (10'b0000000001, 10'b0000000010, 10'b0000000100, ... , 10'b1000000000)

// Derive state transition and output logic equations by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding. Implement only the state transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for this state machine.

// Write code that generates the following equations:

// - B3_next -- next-state logic for state B3
// - S_next
// - S1_next
// - Count_next
// - Wait_next
// - done -- output logic
// - counting
// - shift_ena
