You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
Please generate the verilog RTL code according to the following description and header information:
problem description:
Assume that you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. These numbers are added to produce s[7:0]. Also compute whether a (signed) overflow has occurred.
RTL header:
module top_module (
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	output [7:0] s,
	output overflow
);

please only reply verilog codes. reply_format:
```verilog

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] s,
    output overflow
);
    wire signed [8:0] sum; // 9 bits to capture overflow
    assign sum = {1'b0, a} + {1'b0, b}; // Sign-extend to 9 bits
    assign s = sum[7:0]; // Lower 8 bits of the sum

    // Overflow occurs if the sign of a and b are the same, and the sign of s is different
    assign overflow = (a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7]);

endmodule
```
