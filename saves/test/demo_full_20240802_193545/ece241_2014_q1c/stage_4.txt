You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, a = %d, b = %d, s = %d, overflow = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, a = %d, b = %d, s = %d, overflow = %d", "scenario: 1b, a = %d, b = %d, s = %d, overflow = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	output [7:0] s,
	output overflow
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Assume that you have two 8-bit 2's complement numbers, a[7:0] and b[7:0]. These numbers are added to produce s[7:0]. Also compute whether a (signed) overflow has occurred.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT takes two 8-bit 2's complement signed integers as input: a[7:0] and b[7:0].",
    "2: The DUT produces a single 8-bit 2's complement output, s[7:0], which is the sum of a and b.",
    "3: The DUT detects and outputs an 'overflow' signal, which indicates if an overflow occurred during the addition of a and b.",
    "4: The overflow condition is determined by checking if the sign of a and b are the same, and the sign of the result s is different."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set a = 8'b00001111 (15) and b = 8'b00000001 (1), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 2": "Set a = 8'b01111111 (127) and b = 8'b00000001 (1), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 3": "Set a = 8'b10000000 (-128) and b = 8'b11111111 (-1), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 4": "Set a = 8'b01111110 (126) and b = 8'b00000010 (2), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 5": "Set a = 8'b01111111 (127) and b = 8'b11111111 (-1), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 6": "Set a = 8'b10000001 (-127) and b = 8'b10000001 (-127), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 7": "Set a = 8'b10101010 (-86) and b = 8'b10101010 (-86), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 8": "Set a = 8'b00000000 (0) and b = 8'b00000000 (0), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 9": "Set a = 8'b11111111 (-1) and b = 8'b11111111 (-1), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs.",
  "scenario 10": "Set a = 8'b00111100 (60) and b = 8'b11001100 (-52), wait for 1 clock cycle, then check the outputs."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, a = %d, b = %d, s = %d, overflow = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, a = %d, b = %d, s = %d, overflow = %d", "scenario: 1b, a = %d, b = %d, s = %d, overflow = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
