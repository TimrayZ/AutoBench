You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to positive edge detection). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Module Header: module top_module(input clk, input [7:0] in, output reg [7:0] pedge);",
    "2. DUT Functionality: The DUT should detect rising edges of an 8-bit input vector 'in', setting the corresponding bit in the output vector 'pedge' one clock cycle after the rising edge is detected.",
    "3. Input Signal: The input 'in' is an 8-bit wide vector, where each bit can be either 0 or 1.",
    "4. Output Signal: The output 'pedge' is also an 8-bit wide vector that indicates the detection of rising edges based on the input vector.",
    "5. Clock Signal: The DUT should operate on a rising edge of the 'clk' signal, which will serve as the synchronous clock signal for detection.",
    "6. Transition Detection: The detection mechanism must ensure that a transition from 0 to 1 is correctly identified by comparing the current input vector to the previous one, which must be stored in a register.",
    "7. Timing: The output 'pedge' must remain unchanged until the next clock cycle after the rising edge is detected, ensuring proper timing for signal propagation."

}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [7:0] pedge);
