You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

Please generate the verilog RTL code according to the following description and header information:
problem description:
For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to positive edge detection). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs.
RTL header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [7:0] pedge);

please only reply verilog codes. reply_format:
```verilog

```verilog
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [7:0] pedge
);

reg [7:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    pedge <= (in & ~prev_in); // Detect rising edge
    prev_in <= in; // Store current input for the next clock cycle
end

endmodule
```
