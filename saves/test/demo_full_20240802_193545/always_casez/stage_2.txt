You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Build a priority encoder for 8-bit inputs. Given an 8-bit vector, the output should report the first (least significant) bit in the vector that is 1. Report zero if the input vector has no bits that are high. For example, the input 8'b10010000 should output 3'd4, because bit[4] is first bit that is high.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Specification: The DUT is a priority encoder that takes an 8-bit input vector and outputs the position of the first (least significant) bit that is set to high (1). If no bits are high, the output should be zero.",
    "2. DUT Header: module top_module ( input [7:0] in, output reg [2:0] pos );",
    "3. Input Range: The input 'in' is an 8-bit vector which can have values ranging from 8'b00000000 to 8'b11111111.",
    "4. Output Range: The output 'pos' is a 3-bit vector which can report values from 3'b000 (if input is 0) to 3'b111 (if the first high bit is at index 7).",
    "5. Functional Behavior: For an input of 8'b10010000, the output 'pos' should be 3'd4, as the first high bit is at position 4."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [7:0] in,
	output reg [2:0] pos
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
