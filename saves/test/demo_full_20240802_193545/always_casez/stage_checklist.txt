You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

please check the if the testbench code above contains all the scenarios in the checklist:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00000000 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when no bits are high.",
  "scenario 2": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00000001 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when the least significant bit is high.",
  "scenario 3": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00000010 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when the second least significant bit is high.",
  "scenario 4": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00000100 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when the third least significant bit is high.",
  "scenario 5": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00001000 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when the fourth least significant bit is high.",
  "scenario 6": "Set input 'in' to 8'b10000000 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when the most significant bit is high.",
  "scenario 7": "Set input 'in' to 8'b01010101 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case with multiple bits high and checks the first occurrence.",
  "scenario 8": "Set input 'in' to 8'b11111111 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case when all bits are high.",
  "scenario 9": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00101000 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case with a non-consecutive set of bits high.",
  "scenario 10": "Set input 'in' to 8'b00001111 and wait for 1 clock cycle. This tests the case where multiple lower bits are high."
}
please reply 'YES' if all the items are included. If some of the items are missed in testbench, please add the missing items and reply the modified testbench code (full code).
VERY IMPORTANT: please ONLY reply 'YES' or the full code modified. NEVER remove other irrelevant codes!!!
