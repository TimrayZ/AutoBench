You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, y = %d, w = %d, Y1 = %d, Y3 = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, y = %d, w = %d, Y1 = %d, Y3 = %d", "scenario: 1b, y = %d, w = %d, Y1 = %d, Y3 = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input [5:0] y,
	input w,
	output Y1,
	output Y3
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:

// Consider the state machine shown below:

// A (0) --1--> B
// A (0) --0--> A
// B (0) --1--> C
// B (0) --0--> D
// C (0) --1--> E
// C (0) --0--> D
// D (0) --1--> F
// D (0) --0--> A
// E (1) --1--> E
// E (1) --0--> D
// F (1) --1--> C
// F (1) --0--> D

// Assume that a one-hot code is used with the state assignment y[5:0] = 000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)

// Write a Verilog for the signal Y1, which is the input of state flip-flop y[1], for the signal Y3, which is the input of state flip-flop y[3]. Derive the Verilog by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding.

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "State Machine Transitions: A (0) --1--> B, A (0) --0--> A, B (0) --1--> C, B (0) --0--> D, C (0) --1--> E, C (0) --0--> D, D (0) --1--> F, D (0) --0--> A, E (1) --1--> E, E (1) --0--> D, F (1) --1--> C, F (1) --0--> D. State Assignment: y[5:0] = 000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT has two input signals: a six-bit state vector 'y' representing one-hot encoded states and a single-bit input 'w'.",
    "2: The DUT has two output signals: 'Y1' and 'Y3' which are derived from the state transitions based on the input signal 'w'.",
    "3: The testbench will apply all possible combinations of the input signal 'w' (0 and 1) for each state represented by 'y'.",
    "4: The expected output for 'Y1' and 'Y3' will be determined based on the defined state transition rules in the problem description.",
    "5: The testbench will initialize 'y' to each one-hot state (000001, 000010, 000100, 001000, 010000, 100000) and for each state, will test the responses of 'Y1' and 'Y3' against the expected results derived from the state machine transitions."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize state to A (y = 6'b000001), set w = 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Initialize state to A (y = 6'b000001), set w = 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Initialize state to B (y = 6'b000010), set w = 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Initialize state to B (y = 6'b000010), set w = 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Initialize state to C (y = 6'b000100), set w = 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Initialize state to C (y = 6'b000100), set w = 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 7": "Initialize state to D (y = 6'b001000), set w = 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Initialize state to D (y = 6'b001000), set w = 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 9": "Initialize state to E (y = 6'b010000), set w = 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 10": "Initialize state to E (y = 6'b010000), set w = 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 11": "Initialize state to F (y = 6'b100000), set w = 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 12": "Initialize state to F (y = 6'b100000), set w = 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, y = %d, w = %d, Y1 = %d, Y3 = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, y = %d, w = %d, Y1 = %d, Y3 = %d", "scenario: 1b, y = %d, w = %d, Y1 = %d, Y3 = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
