You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:

// Consider the state machine shown below:

// A (0) --1--> B
// A (0) --0--> A
// B (0) --1--> C
// B (0) --0--> D
// C (0) --1--> E
// C (0) --0--> D
// D (0) --1--> F
// D (0) --0--> A
// E (1) --1--> E
// E (1) --0--> D
// F (1) --1--> C
// F (1) --0--> D

// Assume that a one-hot code is used with the state assignment y[5:0] = 000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)

// Write a Verilog for the signal Y1, which is the input of state flip-flop y[1], for the signal Y3, which is the input of state flip-flop y[3]. Derive the Verilog by inspection assuming a one-hot encoding.

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "State Machine Transitions: A (0) --1--> B, A (0) --0--> A, B (0) --1--> C, B (0) --0--> D, C (0) --1--> E, C (0) --0--> D, D (0) --1--> F, D (0) --0--> A, E (1) --1--> E, E (1) --0--> D, F (1) --1--> C, F (1) --0--> D. State Assignment: y[5:0] = 000001(A), 000010(B), 000100(C), 001000(D), 010000(E), 100000(F)",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT has two input signals: a six-bit state vector 'y' representing one-hot encoded states and a single-bit input 'w'.",
    "2: The DUT has two output signals: 'Y1' and 'Y3' which are derived from the state transitions based on the input signal 'w'.",
    "3: The testbench will apply all possible combinations of the input signal 'w' (0 and 1) for each state represented by 'y'.",
    "4: The expected output for 'Y1' and 'Y3' will be determined based on the defined state transition rules in the problem description.",
    "5: The testbench will initialize 'y' to each one-hot state (000001, 000010, 000100, 001000, 010000, 100000) and for each state, will test the responses of 'Y1' and 'Y3' against the expected results derived from the state machine transitions."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [5:0] y,
	input w,
	output Y1,
	output Y3
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}
