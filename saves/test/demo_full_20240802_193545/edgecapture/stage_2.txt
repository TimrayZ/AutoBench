You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
For each bit in a 32-bit vector, capture when the input signal changes from 1 in one clock cycle to 0 the next. "Capture" means that the output will remain 1 until the register is reset (active high synchronous reset).
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT module is named 'top_module' which interfaces with a clock signal (clk), a synchronous reset signal (reset), a 32-bit input vector (in), and a 32-bit output vector (out).",
    "2. The output vector 'out' should be set to 1 for each bit position where the corresponding bit in the input vector 'in' transitions from 1 to 0 during the clock cycle.",
    "3. The output 'out' will remain high for those specific bit positions until the reset signal is activated (high).",
    "4. The synchronous reset will clear the output 'out' to 0 immediately on the next clock edge after reset becomes high.",
    "5. The input 'in' will be a 32-bit wide vector, meaning the DUT needs to check bit transitions for all 32 bits.",
    "6. The DUT must accommodate signal changes on the 'in' and ensure the capture functionality is correctly implemented through clock cycles."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input reset,
	input [31:0] in,
	output reg [31:0] out);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:

  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",

  "scenario 2": "At time 2, set in = 32'b11111111111111111111111111111111. After 1 clock cycle, change in to 32'b11111111111111111111111111111110. Observe if the corresponding output bit transitions correctly.",

  "scenario 5": "At time 10, assert reset (reset = 1) for 1 clock cycle, then deassert it again (reset = 0). Use in = 32'b00000000000000000000000000000000 during the reset cycle to check that the output resets correctly.",
