You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Consider the follow Moore machine with the diagram described below:

// B (1) --0--> A
// B (1) --1--> B
// A (0) --0--> B
// A (0) --1--> A

// Write Verilog implementing this state machine. It should asynchronously reset into state B if reset if high.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "// State transition diagram:\n// B (1) --0--> A\n// B (1) --1--> B\n// A (0) --0--> B\n// A (0) --1--> A\n\n// Asynchronous reset to state B if areset is high.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT is a Moore machine with two states: A (output 0) and B (output 1).",
    "2. The machine transitions from state B to state A on input '0'.",
    "3. The machine remains in state B on input '1'.",
    "4. The machine transitions from state A to state B on input '0'.",
    "5. The machine remains in state A on input '1'.",
    "6. The machine asynchronously resets to state B when 'areset' is high.",
    "7. The input signals are 'clk', 'in', and 'areset'.",
    "8. The output signal is 'out'.",
    "9. The testbench must apply test cases that cover all transition scenarios and ensure state behavior aligns with the state diagram."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input in,
	input areset,
	output out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Reset the DUT by asserting 'areset' high for 1 clock cycle, then deassert 'areset' and observe the initial output.",
  "scenario 2": "Start from state B, apply input '0' on the rising edge of clk (at cycle 2) and observe the output for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "From state B, apply input '1' on the rising edge of clk (at cycle 3) and observe the output for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Start from state A, apply input '0' on the rising edge of clk (at cycle 4) and observe the output for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "From state A, apply input '1' on the rising edge of clk (at cycle 5) and observe the output for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Reset the DUT again by asserting 'areset' high for 1 clock cycle and confirm the output state is correct after deasserting 'areset'.",
  "scenario 7": "Begin from state B, apply input '0' on the rising edge of clk (at cycle 6), then after 1 clock cycle apply '1' at the next rising edge (cycle 7) and observe states for 2 clock cycles.",
  "scenario 8": "Start from state A, apply input '0' on the rising edge of clk (at cycle 8), then apply '0' again in the next clock cycle (cycle 9) to observe the transition to state B."
