You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Consider the function f shown in the Karnaugh map below. Implement this function.
//        x[1]x[2]
// x[3]x[4]   00 01 11 10
//  00 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
//  01 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
//  11 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
//  10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

    "2: The input signals to the DUT are a 4-bit vector x, where x[4] is the most significant bit.",
    "3: The expected output signal f should reflect the value as per the Karnaugh map for the respective input combination.",
    "4: Test cases should cover all possible combinations of the 4 input bits to ensure complete functionality."
