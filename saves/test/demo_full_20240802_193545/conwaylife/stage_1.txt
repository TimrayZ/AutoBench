You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
The "game" is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either 1 (alive) or 0 (dead). At each time step, each cell changes state depending on how many neighbours it has:
// (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0.
// (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change.
// (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1.
// (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0.
// The game is formulated for an infinite grid. In this circuit, we will use a 16x16 grid. To make things more interesting, we will use a 16x16 toroid, where the sides wrap around to the other side of the grid. For example, the corner cell (0,0) has 8 neighbours: (15,1), (15,0), (15,15), (0,1), (0,15), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,15). The 16x16 grid is represented by a length 256 vector, where each row of 16 cells is represented by a sub-vector: q[15:0] is row 0, q[31:16] is row 1, etc. 
// (1) load: Loads data into q at the next clock edge, for loading initial state. Active high synchronous.
// (2) q: The 16x16 current state of the game, updated every clock cycle.
// The game state should advance by one timestep every clock cycle.
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [255:0] data,
	output reg [255:0] q);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

  "important data": "The grid is a 16x16 toroidal matrix represented as a 256-bit vector (q). Neighbour conditions for cell state transitions: (1) 0-1 neighbour: Cell becomes 0. (2) 2 neighbours: Cell state does not change. (3) 3 neighbours: Cell becomes 1. (4) 4+ neighbours: Cell becomes 0. Active high synchronous load signal for loading initial state.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: The DUT is a synchronous circuit with an active high load signal for loading initial state.",
    "1: Input signals consist of a clock (clk), a load signal (load), and a 256-bit data vector (data) used to initialize the state of the grid.",
    "2: The DUT has a single output, a 256-bit vector (q), representing the current state of the grid.",
    "3: The testbench must generate a sequence of test cases that manipulates the load signal to test initial loading of the grid.",
    "4: The testbench should apply different patterns to the input data and verify the output q after a clock cycle to ensure the DUT correctly computes the next state based on the transition rules.",
    "5: The testbench must account for all edge cases, such as various configurations of live/dead cells and ensure it tests the behavior of cells at the edges of the toroidal grid."
