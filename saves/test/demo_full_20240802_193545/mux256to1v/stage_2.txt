You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer. The 256 4-bit inputs are all packed into a single 1024-bit input vector. sel=0 should select bits in[3:0], sel=1 selects bits in[7:4], sel=2 selects bits in[11:8], etc.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "The DUT is a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer, where sel selects one of the 256 inputs packed into a single 1024-bit vector. The selection mapping is as follows: sel=0 selects in[3:0], sel=1 selects in[7:4], sel=2 selects in[11:8], ..., sel=255 selects in[1023:1020].",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT inputs: in [1023:0], which is a 1024-bit vector containing 256 inputs of 4 bits each.",
    "2. DUT input: sel [7:0], which is an 8-bit selector that determines which of the 256 inputs to pass to the output.",
    "3. DUT output: out [3:0], a 4-bit vector that represents the selected 4-bit output based on the sel input.",
    "4. Testbench needs to generate input signals for 'in' and 'sel' to cover all possible input cases.",
    "5. Expected output signals from DUT should be validated against the correct selection based on sel inputs.",
    "6. Include edge cases such as minimum (sel=0) and maximum (sel=255) selection."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [1023:0] in,
	input [7:0] sel,
	output [3:0] out
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:

{
  "scenario 1": "Set in to a 1024-bit vector where each 4-bit input is initialized with values ranging from 0 to 255 (i.e., in[3:0] = 0, in[7:4] = 1, ..., in[1023:1020] = 255). Set sel to 0. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set in to the same 1024-bit vector as in Scenario 1. Set sel to 1. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Set in to the same 1024-bit vector as in Scenario 1. Set sel to 2. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set in to the same 1024-bit vector as in Scenario 1. Set sel to 255. Wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Set in to a 1024-bit vector where even indexed 4-bit values are set to 0 and odd indexed values to 1 (i.e., in[3:0] = 0, in[7:4] = 1, in[11:8] = 0, in[15:12] = 1, ..., in[1023:1020] = 1). Set sel to random values from 0 to 255 in 16 iterations, waiting 1 clock cycle for each selection.",
  "scenario 6": "Set in to a 1024-bit vector where all bits are initialized to zero. Set sel to random values from 0 to 255 in 16 iterations, waiting 1 clock cycle for each selection.",
  "scenario 7": "Set in to a 1024-bit vector with a pattern like 4, 8, 12, ..., 1020 for the respective 4-bit inputs (i.e., in[3:0] = 4, in[7:4] = 8, ..., in[1023:1020] = 1020). Set sel to values 0, 128, and 255 sequentially, waiting 1 clock cycle after each sel change."
