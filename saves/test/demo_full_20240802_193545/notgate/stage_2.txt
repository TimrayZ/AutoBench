You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a module that implements a NOT gate.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT implements a NOT gate functionality.",
    "2. The DUT has one input signal 'in' and one output signal 'out'.",
    "3. The output 'out' should be the logical inverse of the input 'in'.",
    "4. The input 'in' is a single bit signal (0 or 1).",
    "5. The expected output 'out' should be 1 when 'in' is 0, and 'out' should be 0 when 'in' is 1."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input in,
	output out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Set the input 'in' to 0 at time 0 clock cycles and maintain it for 10 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out'.",
  "scenario 2": "Set the input 'in' to 1 at time 10 clock cycles and maintain it for 10 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out'.",
  "scenario 3": "Toggle the input 'in' to 0 at time 20 clock cycles for 5 clock cycles, then toggle to 1 for 5 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out' during this sequence.",
  "scenario 4": "Set the input 'in' to 1 at time 30 clock cycles and maintain it for 5 clock cycles, then switch to 0 for another 5 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out' during this sequence.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply an input 'in' value of 0 at time 40 clock cycles, switch to 1 at 42 clock cycles, then return to 0 at 44 clock cycles, maintaining each state for 2 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out' for each input change."
