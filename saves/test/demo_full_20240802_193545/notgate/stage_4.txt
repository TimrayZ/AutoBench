You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module(
	input in,
	output out
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Create a module that implements a NOT gate.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT implements a NOT gate functionality.",
    "2. The DUT has one input signal 'in' and one output signal 'out'.",
    "3. The output 'out' should be the logical inverse of the input 'in'.",
    "4. The input 'in' is a single bit signal (0 or 1).",
    "5. The expected output 'out' should be 1 when 'in' is 0, and 'out' should be 0 when 'in' is 1."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set the input 'in' to 0 at time 0 clock cycles and maintain it for 10 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out'.",
  "scenario 2": "Set the input 'in' to 1 at time 10 clock cycles and maintain it for 10 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out'.",
  "scenario 3": "Toggle the input 'in' to 0 at time 20 clock cycles for 5 clock cycles, then toggle to 1 for 5 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out' during this sequence.",
  "scenario 4": "Set the input 'in' to 1 at time 30 clock cycles and maintain it for 5 clock cycles, then switch to 0 for another 5 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out' during this sequence.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply an input 'in' value of 0 at time 40 clock cycles, switch to 1 at 42 clock cycles, then return to 0 at 44 clock cycles, maintaining each state for 2 clock cycles. Observe the output 'out' for each input change."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, in = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, in = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, in = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
