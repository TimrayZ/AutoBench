You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement the following circuit. Create two intermediate wires (named anything you want) to connect the AND and OR gates together. Note that the wire that feeds the NOT gate is really wire `out`, so you do not necessarily need to declare a third wire here. Notice how wires are driven by exactly one source (output of a gate), but can feed multiple inputs.

// The circuit is composed of two layers. The first layer, counting from the input, is two AND gates: one whose input is connected to a and b, and the second is connected to c and d. The second layer there is an OR gate to OR the two AND outputs, connected the output 'out'. Additionally, there is an inverted output 'out_n'.
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input a,
	input b,
	input c,
	input d,
	output out,
	output out_n );

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

    "1. DUT Module Header: module top_module ( input a, input b, input c, input d, output out, output out_n );",
    "2. The DUT implements a combinational logic circuit consisting of two AND gates feeding into an OR gate.",
    "3. The first AND gate takes inputs 'a' and 'b', while the second AND gate takes inputs 'c' and 'd'.",
    "4. The output of the OR gate feeds the output 'out' of the DUT.",
    "5. The inverted output is provided as 'out_n', which is the NOT of the output 'out'.",
    "6. The testbench will generate various input combinations for a, b, c, and d to validate the correctness of the outputs 'out' and 'out_n'.",
    "7. The expected results for 'out' will be based on the logical OR of the two AND gate outputs.",
    "8. The expected results for 'out_n' will be the logical NOT of 'out'."
