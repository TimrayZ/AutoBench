You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement the following circuit. Create two intermediate wires (named anything you want) to connect the AND and OR gates together. Note that the wire that feeds the NOT gate is really wire `out`, so you do not necessarily need to declare a third wire here. Notice how wires are driven by exactly one source (output of a gate), but can feed multiple inputs.

// The circuit is composed of two layers. The first layer, counting from the input, is two AND gates: one whose input is connected to a and b, and the second is connected to c and d. The second layer there is an OR gate to OR the two AND outputs, connected the output 'out'. Additionally, there is an inverted output 'out_n'.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. DUT Module Header: module top_module ( input a, input b, input c, input d, output out, output out_n );",
    "2. The DUT implements a combinational logic circuit consisting of two AND gates feeding into an OR gate.",
    "3. The first AND gate takes inputs 'a' and 'b', while the second AND gate takes inputs 'c' and 'd'.",
    "4. The output of the OR gate feeds the output 'out' of the DUT.",
    "5. The inverted output is provided as 'out_n', which is the NOT of the output 'out'.",
    "6. The testbench will generate various input combinations for a, b, c, and d to validate the correctness of the outputs 'out' and 'out_n'.",
    "7. The expected results for 'out' will be based on the logical OR of the two AND gate outputs.",
    "8. The expected results for 'out_n' will be the logical NOT of 'out'."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input a,
	input b,
	input c,
	input d,
	output out,
	output out_n );
