You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
This is a Moore state machine with two states, one input, and one output. Implement this state machine in Verilog. The reset state is B and reset is active-high synchronous.

// B (out=1) --in=0--> A
// B (out=1) --in=1--> B
// A (out=0) --in=0--> B
// A (out=0) --in=1--> A
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "This is a Moore state machine with two states, one input (in), and one output (out). The state transitions and outputs are defined as follows: B (out=1) --in=0--> A, B (out=1) --in=1--> B, A (out=0) --in=0--> B, A (out=0) --in=1--> A. The reset state is B and reset is active-high synchronous.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The module top_module has four ports: input clk, input in, input reset, and output out.",
    "2. The reset signal is active-high and synchronous, meaning when reset is high, the state machine should transition to state B.",
    "3. The output out is determined by the current state of the state machine, specifically out=1 when in state B and out=0 when in state A.",
    "4. The state machine has two states: A and B.",
    "5. The state transition logic must adhere to the specified transitions based on the input signal in."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input in,
	input reset,
	output out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}

{
  "scenario 1": "Apply reset signal high for one clock cycle (clk = 0 to 1) and then drive reset low. Monitor the output out after the reset for valid transitions.",
  "scenario 2": "After releasing reset, set input in to 0 for one clock cycle (clk = 1 to 2) and observe the output. Continue driving input in to 0 for another clock cycle (clk = 2 to 3) to check transitions.",
  "scenario 3": "Set input in to 1 for one clock cycle (clk = 3 to 4) and observe the output. Continue driving input in to 1 for the next clock cycle (clk = 4 to 5) to check the sustained state.",
  "scenario 4": "Set input in back to 0 for one clock cycle (clk = 5 to 6) and observe the output. Continue driving input in to 0 for the next clock cycle (clk = 6 to 7) for state transitions.",
  "scenario 5": "Drive reset high for one clock cycle (clk = 7 to 8), then set reset low and immediately change input in to 1 for one clock cycle (clk = 8 to 9) to evaluate output after reset.",
  "scenario 6": "Set input in to 0 for one clock cycle (clk = 9 to 10) after the previous scenario and observe output again to confirm transitions.",
  "scenario 7": "In the last scenario, sequentially alternate between in = 1 and in = 0 for one clock cycle each (clock cycles 10 to 11 for in = 1, and 11 to 12 for in = 0) to fully explore state transition paths."
