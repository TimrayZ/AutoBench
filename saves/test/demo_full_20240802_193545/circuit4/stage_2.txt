You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
This is a combinational circuit. Read the simulation waveforms to determine what the circuit does, then implement it.

RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "This is a combinational circuit. The output 'q' is determined by the inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The simulation waveforms indicate specific combinations of inputs leading to defined outputs at various times.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0. The module header defines four input signals (a, b, c, d) and one output signal (q).",
    "1. The DUT processes the inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' according to the specified behavior observed in the simulation waveforms.",
    "2. Output 'q' is checked for correctness based on the corresponding input combinations and timings as per the provided waveform table.",
    "3. Testbench should apply various combinations of inputs in the range of the waveform timings (0ns to 90ns) and compare the produced outputs with the expected results.",
    "4. Include stimulus generation that covers all possible combinations of the inputs to thoroughly validate the DUT.",
    "5. The expected outputs should be derived from the simulation waveform provided, mapping each input combination to the corresponding 'q' output."

DUT header:
module top_module (
	input a, 
	input b, 
	input c, 
	input d,
	output q
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
