You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input vector. Build a population count circuit for a 3-bit input vector.
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "The population count circuit counts the number of '1's in a 3-bit input vector.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT has a 3-bit input vector named 'in'.",
    "2: The DUT has a 2-bit output vector named 'out'.",
    "3: The primary function of the DUT is to count the number of '1's present in the input vector 'in'.",
    "4: The expected output value 'out' ranges from 0 to 3, representing the count of '1's in the input.",
    "5: The testbench must apply all possible combinations of the 3-bit input vector (from 000 to 111) to verify the correctness of the DUT.",
    "6: The testbench should check if the output from the DUT matches the expected population count for each given input."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [2:0] in,
	output [1:0] out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
}
