You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map below.

//        ab
// cd   00 01 11 10
//  00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
//  01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
//  11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
//  10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Karnaugh map for the function to be implemented: ab | cd | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: The DUT has 4 input signals (a, b, c, d) and 1 output signal (out).",
    "1: The expected output conditions based on the given Karnaugh map must be defined for every possible combination of input signals.",
    "2: The testbench should systematically test all 16 combinations of inputs (a, b, c, d).",
    "3: For each combination of input values, the expected output should be calculated according to the Karnaugh map.",
    "4: The testbench should include `initial` block to apply test inputs and a mechanism to display results in the simulation output for verification purposes.",
    "5: Error checking mechanism should be implemented to compare DUT outputs against expected outputs, printing a message indicating pass or fail."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input a, 
	input b,
	input c,
	input d,
	output out
);
