You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to complete a given verilog testbench code. This testbench is for a verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). This circuit is a sequential circuit. The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. test scenarios which determines values and sequential information of test vectors
- 1.4. the testbench structure
- 1.5. the instruction of writing our testbench

DUT header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input in,
	output logic out
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Implement in Verilog the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as input the output of a two-input XOR. The flip-flop is positive edge triggered by clk, but there is no reset. The XOR takes as input 'in' along with the output 'out' of the flip-flop.
IMPORTANT - test scenario (Please determine the values of input signals according to these test scenarios.):
{
  "scenario 1": "Initialize the clk signal to 0 and in signal to 0. Then toggle the clk signal to 1 at the positive edge (clock cycle 1). Observe the out signal after this clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set the in signal to 1 while keeping clk at 0. Toggle the clk signal to 1 at the positive edge (clock cycle 3). Check the out signal at this time.",
  "scenario 3": "Hold the clk signal at 1 and change the in signal to 0. Toggle the clk signal to 0 and then back to 1 at the positive edge (clock cycle 5). Monitor the out signal after this clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Reset the in signal to 1 while clk is 0. Bring clk to 1 at the positive edge (clock cycle 7). Check the out signal state at this clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Set in to 0 while keeping clk at 1. Change in to 1 while clk remains high (clock cycle 9). Toggle clk to 0 and then back to 1 at the positive edge (clock cycle 10). Observe the out signal after this clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Hold the clk signal low (0) and change the in signal from 0 to 1 before toggling clk to 1 at clock cycle 12. Observe the out signal after this clock cycle.",
  "scenario 7": "Begin with clk = 0 and in = 1. Toggle clk to 1 on clock cycle 14. Change in to 0 during the next clk high cycle (15). Monitor the out signal after this clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Keep clk at 1 and change the in signal from 0 to 1, and then change it back to 0 before toggling clk to 0 on clock cycle 17. Toggle clk back to 1 at the next clock cycle (18) and observe the out afterwards."
}
below is the given testbench codes:
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module testbench;
reg  clk;
reg  in;
wire  out;

integer file, scenario;
// DUT instantiation
top_module DUT (
	.clk(clk),
	.in(in),
	.out(out)
);
// Clock generation
initial begin
    clk = 0;
    forever #5 clk = ~clk;
end

initial begin
    file = $fopen("TBout.txt", "w");
end
// Scenario Based Test
initial begin

    // write your scenario checking codes here, according to scenario information

    $fclose(file);
    $finish;
end

endmodule


The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT. Please export the signals of DUT to a file named "TBout.txt" at the end of each scenario. The template is given below:
$fdisplay(file, "[check]scenario: %d, clk = %d, in = %d, out = %d", scenario, clk, in, out);
The variables are already declared. The clock signal is already prepared. This output will be used to check the correctness of the DUT's output later.
please only use "#10" as the delay when you need. If you need longer delay, you can use multiple "#10", such as "#10; #10; #10;". Avoid meaningless long delay in your code.
If you need a loop in a scenario to check multiple time points, use "repeat" loop. for exmaple:
```
// scenario x
scenario = x;
signal_1 = 1;
repeat(5) begin
    $fdisplay(file, "[check]scenario: %d, clk = %d, in = %d, out = %d", scenario, clk, in, out);
    #10;
end
```
Please determine the input signal's exact values according to given test scenarios. 
Note: please complete the last initial code part (marked in the given testbench template). You should give me the completed full code. The testbench template above is to help you generate the code. You must use %d when exporting values.
please generate the full testbench code. please only reply verilog codes, no other words.
