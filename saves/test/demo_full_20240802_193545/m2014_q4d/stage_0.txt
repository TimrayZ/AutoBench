You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

Please generate the verilog RTL code according to the following description and header information:
problem description:
Implement in Verilog the following circuit: A D flip-flop takes as input the output of a two-input XOR. The flip-flop is positive edge triggered by clk, but there is no reset. The XOR takes as input 'in' along with the output 'out' of the flip-flop.
RTL header:
module top_module (
	input clk,
	input in,
	output logic out
);

please only reply verilog codes. reply_format:
```verilog

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input in,
    output logic out
);

    logic d; // Intermediate signal for the D flip-flop

    // XOR operation
    assign d = in ^ out;

    // D Flip-Flop
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= d;
    end

endmodule
```
