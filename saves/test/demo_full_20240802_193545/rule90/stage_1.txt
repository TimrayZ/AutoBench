You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. You are in the first stage. In this stage, please summarize the technical details of the DUT and give me a technical specification of the testbench generation task, so we can use it to design its corresponding testbench.
3. The core of testbench is the testcases. It usually include two parts logically: the input signals to the DUT and the expected result signals from DUT. The testbench will send the input signals to DUT and check if the result signals are the same as the expected result signals. If they are the same, this means the DUT is passed. Otherwise the DUT fails.
4. Your technical specification should include these sections:
- section 1: specification of the DUT, including the module header of the RTL code. If table or other detailed data is provided in the original problem description, DO repeat them in your response. They are very important!!!
5. your response should be in the form of JSON.
6. below is the information including the problem description and the DUT header:
RTL circuit problem description:
Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting properties. The rules are simple. There is a one-dimensional array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the next state of each cell is the XOR of the cell's two current neighbours:
// Left | Center | Right | Center's next state
// 1 | 1 | 1 | 0
// 1 | 1 | 0 | 1
// 1 | 0 | 1 | 0
// 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 1 | 1
// 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 
// 0 | 0 | 1 | 1
// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
// In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one time step each clock cycle. The load input indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0]. Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).
DUT header:
module top_module(
	input clk,
	input load,
	input [511:0] data,
	output reg [511:0] q);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "important data": "...", # type: string. If no table, state transition or other direct data, leave this with ""
  "technical specifications": ["...", "...", ...] # each element of the list is one specification string, the starting of the string is its index 
}

{
  "important data": "Rule 90 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton that updates the state of an array of cells based on the XOR of each cell with its two neighbors. The DUT processes a 512-cell array (q[511:0]) and has specific behavior based on the load input to initialize its state with a provided data array.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The DUT module name is top_module.",
    "2: The DUT has three inputs: clk (clock), load (control signal), and data (initial state of the cells).",
    "3: The DUT output is q, which is a 512-bit wide register representing the current state of the cellular automaton.",
    "4: The state transition for each center cell q[i] is determined by the XOR of its two immediate neighbors (q[i-1] and q[i+1]), with the condition that q[-1] and q[512] are considered to be 0.",
    "5: The DUT must load the initial state when the load signal is asserted on the rising edge of clk.",
    "6: The output should reflect the new state of the array after each clock cycle if load is not active."
