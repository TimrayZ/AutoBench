You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Consider the function f shown in the Karnaugh map below. d is don't-care, which means you may choose to output whatever value is convenient. Implement this function. 
//        x[1]x[2]
// x[3]x[4]   00 01 11 10
//  00 | d | 0 | d | d |
//  01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |
//  11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |
//  10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Karnaugh map for function f with don't-care conditions.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT module is named 'top_module'.",
    "2. The DUT has one input 'x' which is a 4-bit vector (x[4:1]).",
    "3. The DUT has one output 'f' which is of type 'logic'.",
    "4. The function f is determined by the Karnaugh map provided, outlining specific combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs.",
    "5. The output for the input combinations is as follows: for x[3]x[4] = 00, it's a don't-care; for 01, output is 0; for 11, output is 1; for 10, output is 1.",
    "6. The output can also produce a don't-care condition for certain input combinations."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [4:1] x,
	output logic f
);

your response must be in JSON form. example:
