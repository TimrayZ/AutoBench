You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, x = %d, f = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, x = %d, f = %d", "scenario: 1b, x = %d, f = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input [4:1] x,
	output logic f
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Consider the function f shown in the Karnaugh map below. d is don't-care, which means you may choose to output whatever value is convenient. Implement this function. 
//        x[1]x[2]
// x[3]x[4]   00 01 11 10
//  00 | d | 0 | d | d |
//  01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |
//  11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |
//  10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Karnaugh map for function f with don't-care conditions.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1. The DUT module is named 'top_module'.",
    "2. The DUT has one input 'x' which is a 4-bit vector (x[4:1]).",
    "3. The DUT has one output 'f' which is of type 'logic'.",
    "4. The function f is determined by the Karnaugh map provided, outlining specific combinations of inputs and their corresponding outputs.",
    "5. The output for the input combinations is as follows: for x[3]x[4] = 00, it's a don't-care; for 01, output is 0; for 11, output is 1; for 10, output is 1.",
    "6. The output can also produce a don't-care condition for certain input combinations."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Set x to 4'b0000, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 2": "Set x to 4'b0001, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 3": "Set x to 4'b0010, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 4": "Set x to 4'b0011, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 5": "Set x to 4'b0100, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 6": "Set x to 4'b0101, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 7": "Set x to 4'b0110, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 8": "Set x to 4'b0111, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 9": "Set x to 4'b1000, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 10": "Set x to 4'b1001, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 11": "Set x to 4'b1010, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 12": "Set x to 4'b1011, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 13": "Set x to 4'b1100, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 14": "Set x to 4'b1101, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 15": "Set x to 4'b1110, wait for 1 clock cycle.",
  "scenario 16": "Set x to 4'b1111, wait for 1 clock cycle."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, x = %d, f = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, x = %d, f = %d", "scenario: 1b, x = %d, f = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
