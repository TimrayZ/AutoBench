You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
Please generate the verilog RTL code according to the following description and header information:
problem description:
Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.
RTL header:
module top_module(
	input [2:0] a, 
	input [2:0] b, 
	output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
	output out_or_logical,
	output [5:0] out_not
);

please only reply verilog codes. reply_format:
```verilog

```verilog

    input [2:0] b, 
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);
    
    // Bitwise OR of the two input vectors
    assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;
    
    // Logical OR of the two input vectors
    assign out_or_logical = |(a) | |(b);
    
    // Inverse (NOT) of both vectors, with b in the upper half and a in the lower half
    assign out_not = {~b, ~a};
