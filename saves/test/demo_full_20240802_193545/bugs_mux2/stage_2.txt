You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########
1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Find the bug and fix this 8-bit wide 2-to-1 mux.

// module top_module (
//     input sel,
//     input [7:0] a,
//     input [7:0] b,
//     output out  );

//     assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

// endmodule
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Find the bug and fix this 8-bit wide 2-to-1 mux.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: DUT is a 2-to-1 multiplexer with 8-bit wide input signals a and b.",
    "1: The DUT includes one selection input sel to control the data flow between inputs a and b to output out.",
    "2: The output out is defined as a reg type, indicating it will be assigned within an always block or through continuous assignments.",
    "3: The original logic for the output is implemented incorrectly, needing to confirm if the fix resolves the issue.",
    "4: The expected operation is 'out' should equal 'a' when sel is 0, and 'out' should equal 'b' when sel is 1."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input sel,
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	output reg [7:0] out
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...

  "scenario 1": "Apply sel = 0, a = 8'b10101010, b = 8'b01010101. This test will check if the output 'out' correctly receives the value from input 'a'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 2": "Apply sel = 1, a = 8'b10101010, b = 8'b01010101. This test will check if the output 'out' correctly receives the value from input 'b'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 3": "Apply sel = 0, a = 8'b00000000, b = 8'b11111111. This test will verify the output when input 'a' is at its minimum and input 'b' is at its maximum. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 4": "Apply sel = 1, a = 8'b00000000, b = 8'b11111111. This test will verify the output when input 'a' is at its minimum and input 'b' is at its maximum. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply sel = 0, a = 8'b11001100, b = 8'b00110011. This test will ensure that when sel is low, the 'out' should reflect the value of 'a'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 6": "Apply sel = 1, a = 8'b11001100, b = 8'b00110011. This test will ensure that when sel is high, the 'out' should reflect the value of 'b'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 7": "Apply multiple rapid changes to sel while maintaining a constant input for both a and b. For example, a = 8'b10101010, b = 8'b01010101, toggle sel every clock cycle for 4 cycles. This test will confirm the DUT's responsiveness to quick changes in selection."
