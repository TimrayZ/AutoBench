You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

########## user ##########

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is 
- 1.1. the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". 
- 1.2. the module header.
- 1.3. the technical specification of testbench
- 1.4. test scenarios which determines value and sequential information of test vectors

2. you are in section 4. in this section, our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can export the input and output signals of DUT at the important time points. The exported data will be send to a python script to check the correctness of DUT. 
ATTENTION: The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt".
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, sel = %d, a = %d, b = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, sel = %d, a = %d, b = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, sel = %d, a = %d, b = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header:

module top_module (
	input sel,
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	output reg [7:0] out
);

Your other information:
RTL circuit problem description:
Find the bug and fix this 8-bit wide 2-to-1 mux.

// module top_module (
//     input sel,
//     input [7:0] a,
//     input [7:0] b,
//     output out  );

//     assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

// endmodule
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "Find the bug and fix this 8-bit wide 2-to-1 mux.",
  "technical specifications": [
    "0: DUT is a 2-to-1 multiplexer with 8-bit wide input signals a and b.",
    "1: The DUT includes one selection input sel to control the data flow between inputs a and b to output out.",
    "2: The output out is defined as a reg type, indicating it will be assigned within an always block or through continuous assignments.",
    "3: The original logic for the output is implemented incorrectly, needing to confirm if the fix resolves the issue.",
    "4: The expected operation is 'out' should equal 'a' when sel is 0, and 'out' should equal 'b' when sel is 1."
  ]
}
IMPORTANT - test scenario:
{
  "scenario 1": "Apply sel = 0, a = 8'b10101010, b = 8'b01010101. This test will check if the output 'out' correctly receives the value from input 'a'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 2": "Apply sel = 1, a = 8'b10101010, b = 8'b01010101. This test will check if the output 'out' correctly receives the value from input 'b'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 3": "Apply sel = 0, a = 8'b00000000, b = 8'b11111111. This test will verify the output when input 'a' is at its minimum and input 'b' is at its maximum. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 4": "Apply sel = 1, a = 8'b00000000, b = 8'b11111111. This test will verify the output when input 'a' is at its minimum and input 'b' is at its maximum. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 5": "Apply sel = 0, a = 8'b11001100, b = 8'b00110011. This test will ensure that when sel is low, the 'out' should reflect the value of 'a'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 6": "Apply sel = 1, a = 8'b11001100, b = 8'b00110011. This test will ensure that when sel is high, the 'out' should reflect the value of 'b'. Wait for 1 clock cycle after applying the inputs.",
  "scenario 7": "Apply multiple rapid changes to sel while maintaining a constant input for both a and b. For example, a = 8'b10101010, b = 8'b01010101, toggle sel every clock cycle for 4 cycles. This test will confirm the DUT's responsiveness to quick changes in selection."
}

The testbench does not need to check the DUT's output but only export the signals of DUT.
Instruction of saving signals to file: 
(1) you should use $fopen and $fdisplay to export the important signals in testbench. the file name is "TBout.txt". 
(2) When running testbench, for one time point, you should export 1 line. the example of the printed line is "scenario: 1, sel = %d, a = %d, b = %d, out = %d"; If one scenario has multiple test cases, use letter suffix to represent different test cases, like "scenario: 1a, sel = %d, a = %d, b = %d, out = %d", "scenario: 1b, sel = %d, a = %d, b = %d, out = %d".
(3) Attention: before $fdisplay, you should always have a delay statement to make sure the signals are stable.
(4) the signals you save is the input and output of DUT, you should determine the signals according to DUT's header.
please only generate the verilog codes, no other words.
