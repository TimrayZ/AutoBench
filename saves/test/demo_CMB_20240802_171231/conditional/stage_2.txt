You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. Your task is to write a verilog testbench for an verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). The infomation we have is the problem description that guides student to write the RTL code (DUT) and the header of the "DUT". Our target is to generate the verilog testbench for the DUT. This testbench can check if the DUT in verilog satisfies all technical requirements of the problem description.
2. you are in section 2. in this section, please give me the test scenarios. you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 
3. your information is:
RTL circuit problem description:
Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
RTL testbench specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The Device Under Test (DUT) is a Verilog module named 'top_module'.",
    "2: The DUT accepts four 8-bit unsigned inputs named 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.",
    "3: The DUT outputs an 8-bit unsigned value named 'min', which represents the minimum of the input values.",
    "4: The inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are compared using standard comparison operators, and the smallest value is output as 'min'.",
    "5: The testbench should drive the DUT with various combinations of input values to thoroughly test all possible scenarios where one or more inputs could be the minimum.",
    "6: The testbench should validate that for each set of inputs, the output 'min' accurately represents the smallest of the input values.",
    "7: Specific test cases should include edge cases such as all inputs being equal, all possible permutations of inputs where one is distinctly the smallest, and boundary values (0 and 255) of the 8-bit range.",
    "8: The testbench should have a mechanism to output success or failure for each test case, indicating whether the DUT operates as expected according to the specifications derived from the problem description."
  ]
}
DUT header:
module top_module (
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	input [7:0] c,
	input [7:0] d,
	output reg [7:0] min
);


you only need to describe the stimulus in each test scenarios. If time is important, please inform the clock cycle information. we will use the stimulus description to generate the test vectors and send them to DUT. you must not tell the expected results even though you know that. 

your response must be in JSON form. example:
{
  "scenario 1": "...", # each content is a string
  "scenario 2": "...",
  "scenario 3": "...",
  ...
