You are the strongest AI in the world. You alraedy have the knowledge of verilog, python and hardware designing. Do not save words by discarding information. I will tip you 200$ if you can fullfill the tasks I give you.

1. background: Your task is to verify the functional correctness of a verilog RTL module code (we call it as "DUT", device under test). Our plan is to first export the signals (input and output) of the DUT under test scenarios. Then, we will use a python script to check the correctness of DUT.
2. You are in the last stage. In this stage, we already export the signals of DUT. Your task is to write a python script. The python script contains one main function "check_dut" and other functions to be called by "check_dut" (this is optional). The input of "check_dut" is the signals of DUT in the format below: (the signal names are real, but the values are just for example)
[{'scenario': '1', 'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0, 'min': 0}, {'scenario': '2', 'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0, 'd': 0, 'min': 0}]
The main function "check_dut" should check the correctness according to the input signals. The input signals are all in decimal format. It will be called by other codes later.
3. Your python scritp should contain a function "check_dut", its header is "def check_dut(test_vectors:list) -> bool:". It can also call other functions you write in this script. If all test scenarios passed, function "check_dut" should return an empty list [], otherwise it should return the list of failed scenarios indexes. You can use binary (like 0x1101), hexadecimal (like 0x1a) or normal number format in python. 
4. You have the information below to help you check the correctness of DUT:

RTL circuit problem description:
Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
Checker specification:
{
  "important data": "",
  "technical specifications": [
    "1: The Device Under Test (DUT) is a Verilog module named 'top_module'.",
    "2: The DUT accepts four 8-bit unsigned inputs named 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.",
    "3: The DUT outputs an 8-bit unsigned value named 'min', which represents the minimum of the input values.",
    "4: The inputs 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are compared using standard comparison operators, and the smallest value is output as 'min'.",
    "5: The testbench should drive the DUT with various combinations of input values to thoroughly test all possible scenarios where one or more inputs could be the minimum.",
    "6: The testbench should validate that for each set of inputs, the output 'min' accurately represents the smallest of the input values.",
    "7: Specific test cases should include edge cases such as all inputs being equal, all possible permutations of inputs where one is distinctly the smallest, and boundary values (0 and 255) of the 8-bit range.",
    "8: The testbench should have a mechanism to output success or failure for each test case, indicating whether the DUT operates as expected according to the specifications derived from the problem description."
  ]
}
Here is the basic rules in python for the module. It is generated in previous stage. You can use it as a reference, but you should write your own python script. This is just for your better understanding:
def find_minimum(a, b, c, d):
    """
    Compute the minimum of four 8-bit unsigned integers.
    
    Parameters:
    - a (int): The first input integer.
    - b (int): The second input integer.
    - c (int): The third input integer.
    - d (int): The fourth input integer.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The minimum value among the input integers.
    """
    # Calculate the minimum of the four numbers
    min_value = min(a, b, c, d)
    return min_value

# Sample usage with test scenario 2
min_value = find_minimum(200, 200, 50, 200)
print(f"The computed minimum value is: {min_value}")



[IMPORTANT] Your python scritp should contain a function "check_dut", its header is "def check_dut(test_vectors:list) -> bool:". It can also call other functions you write in this script. If all test scenarios passed, function "check_dut" should return an empty list [], otherwise it should return the list of failed scenarios indexes. You can use binary (like 0x1101), hexadecimal (like 0x1a) or normal number format in python.
Optional: You can also use functions from numpy and scipy to help you check the correctness of DUT.
you can use binary (like 0b1011), hexadeciaml (like 0x1a) or normal number format in python for convenience. 
please only generate the python codes, no other words.
